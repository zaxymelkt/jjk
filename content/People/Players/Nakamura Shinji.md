# Early Childhood
Shinji was born in a normal hospital from an average mother and was a part of a standard family, at least by the standards of whatever place he lived in, which was also a very quiet and uninteresting place where nothing happened. The population was very small and close-knit.

However! Shinji is the exception. For half a decade, he knew no one, and spoke to no one. When he was born, he didn’t cry, and this would continue up until the age of five when he finally spoke his first words. Some children may find their first experience communicating by saying basic words, such as “mama”, or “papa”, but Shinji’s first words were “Can I get a glass of water, please.”. The entire time, he knew how to speak, but chose not to!
# Middle Childhood
This did not last very long, no, not at all. He remained distant from the other children up until the age of eight, where he finally made his first friend. One day in school he asked to borrow a pencil, and after class, this spiralled into an entire interaction. His lack of social experience showed the entire time, but he was not embarrassed and did not feel awkward even though a normal child would definitely think of the interaction from an outsider's perspective as such.

A year prior however, he received glasses from some guy who was doing a little trolling, which allowed Shinji to see curses.

**Martial Adept**
[ Martial Adept] Quick Reload
Shinji can reload his Boomstick faster, allowing for two more shells to be loaded, allowing the gun to be fired two more times in the same turn or even while it would normally be on cooldown. Once fired, the cooldown will reset.
- This consumes 1 action and has a cooldown of 2 turns.
- These two shots will have increased potency, traveling at Reaction +2 and damaging at Strength +2 on top of the normal buffs.

[ Martial Adept ] Asura's Defiance
When using this technique, Shinji moves at such a speed that he appears to have multiple sets of hands. As such, he's able to switch off from the weapon he's using to a different one almost instantly and use it within the same action.
- This move can be used for 4 actions in a single turn and has a cooldown of 4 turns.
- When switching to other weapons, they will move at a heightened speed of +6.
- This technique will also give +2 target focus while being used.
