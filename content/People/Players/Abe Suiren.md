Abe Suiren hails from both the Zenin and Abe clan. They were born with the innate technique of “The [[Ten Shadows]]”. After generations, Suiren would be the 2nd sorcerer born in her families. Ever since childhood, she was called “Shadow Monarch” due to her innate technique. The young girl is half American and Japanese.
# Early Childhood
Born in [[Osaka]], Japan, a large city with a population of around 2.691 million. With a rough population density of 12,214 people every square kilometer, Abe Suiren would have found herself bumping into other sorcerers like herself daily.

Born into both the [[Jujutsu Clans#Zen'in|Zenin]] and [[Jujutsu Clans#Abe|Abe Clan]], Suiren is consider to be one of the sorcerer with the biggest potential in her families. After being born, her innate technique would be called "the [[Ten Shadows]]," a powerful technique to her knowledge from her Zenin bloodline. 

It is said the Abe Clan has birthed the most potent members that even influence the jujutsu society of modern times. This includes her mother’s clan called the Zenin Clan.

Suiren and her family would then move to [[Semboku City|Semboku]], Japan along with her cousin, [[Abe Toma]] where they will settle for most of their childhood. She and Toma would be seen hanging out often when practising their skills. 

# Middle Childhood
At the tender age of six, Suiren’s discovery of her natural ability, the "[[Ten Shadows]]" Technique, was both a revelation and a mystery. Her father's insistence on keeping it hidden from the Zenin Clan intrigued her, but she trusted his judgment implicitly. Though she didn't understand his reasons at the time, she obediently practiced her technique in private, away from prying eyes.

It was Suiren’s mother who provided clarity and guidance, explaining the intricacies of the technique and how Suiren could further develop her abilities. With her mother's support, Suiren embarked on a journey of self-discovery, delving into the depths of her newfound power and learning to summon and control more shikigamis.

But mastering her innate technique was only part of Suiren's training regimen. With her cousin Toma by her side, she honed her combat skills through rigorous training in hand-to-hand combat, kenjutsu, and bojutsu. While Toma excelled in all aspects, Suiren focused primarily on kenjutsu, channeling her curse energy to enhance her swordsmanship and become a formidable warrior in her own right. Together, they pushed each other to their limits, growing stronger and more skilled with each passing day.

# Late Childhood
As Suiren grew older, her thirst for knowledge and mastery of her abilities only intensified. Recognizing the importance of honing her skills in kenjutsu, she made the decision to join a prestigious dojo renowned for its rigorous training and seasoned instructors.

At the dojo, Suiren found herself immersed in a world of discipline and tradition. Under the watchful eye of her sensei, she devoted herself wholeheartedly to the art of Judo, diligently practicing the precise movements and techniques required to grapple and take down even the biggest of oppents down to the earth.

But Suiren’s training didn't stop there. In her quest to become a more versatile and formidable warrior, she sought to integrate her "10 Shadows" technique into her martial arts practice. Alone in the quiet of her training grounds, she experimented with ways to incorporate the shikigami into her fightung style, using them to enhance her defense.

# Early Teens
Suiren and her cousin Toma navigated the bustling streets of Kyoto with the ease of locals, their school bags slung over their shoulders as they made their way to the bustling public school they attended. Despite the demands of their rigorous training and studies, they cherished the opportunity to experience a slice of ordinary teenage life.

Once inside the school gates, they parted ways to join their respective clubs. Suiren gravitated towards the Judo club, eager to further refine her skills in martial arts under the guidance of experienced instructors. With each spirited bout and intense practice session, she found herself growing stronger and more confident in her abilities.

Meanwhile, Toma found his passion in the kyudo club, where he soon became the best archer in the school. Despite their different interests, Suiren and Toma shared a common goal: to push themselves to the limits and excel in their chosen pursuits.

After school, Suiren and Toma reunited, their laughter ringing out as they shared stories of their day and made plans for the evening. Whether it was exploring the vibrant streets of Kyoto, indulging in their favorite street food, or simply enjoying each other's company in the peaceful surroundings of a local park.

# Middle Teens
Suiren’s world was turned upside down when her secret was unexpectedly exposed. While training in a secluded partof Kyoto's outskirts, she was discovered by a member of the powerful Zenin Clan, who witnessed her expertly manipulating her "10 Shadow" technique. Shocked and alarmed by her abilities, the clan member wasted no time in reporting her to their superiors.

In the aftermath of the revelation, Suiren’s family faced pressure from the Zenin Clan to relinquish their daughter to their custody. Sensing the danger looming over her, Suiren’s parents made the difficult decision to send her away, enrolling her in Jujutsu High, a renowned institution known for nurturing and training young sorcerers.

Despite the initial upheaval and uncertainty, Suiren embraced her new surroundings with determination and resolve. At Jujutsu High, she found herself among peers who shared her passion for the mystic arts, and she thrived in the rigorous and challenging environment.

Under the tutelage of skilled instructors, Suiren honed her abilities further, delving deeper into the complexities of curse techniques and combat training. With each passing day, she grew stronger and more proficient, determined to prove herself worthy of her place at the prestigious academy.
Though the shadow of the Zenin Clan's scrutiny still loomed over her, Suiren refused to be cowed. With unwavering determination and the support of her newfound allies, she embarked on a journey of self-discovery and growth, ready to face whatever challenges awaited her on the path of a jujutsu sorcerer.
