Inumaki Kousei hails from the prestigious Inumaki clan, known for its mastery of the [[Cursed Speech]] Technique. He stands as the epitome of purity within his familial lineage, a contrast to his older half-brother who is perceived as a bastard due to his illegitimate status.
# Early Childhood
Born into the illustrious Inumaki clan in the serene city of [[Ise City|Ise]], Japan, Kousei's earliest years were steeped in nurturing and traditions of his esteemed lineage. Kousei radiated pure raw potential with High Cursed Energy Reserves and having Cursed Speech unlocked from birth. However, amidst the tranquillity of his upbringing, there lurked an underlying tension fueled by the presence of his older half-brother, Mogaku.

Mogaku, being the offspring of his father's previous relationship, stood as a constant reminder of the family's past complexities and clear differences in appearance alone. 

Despite attempts to integrate him into the fold, Mogaku's presence often cast a shadow over Kousei's innocence, creating a subtle but palpable divide within the familial dynamics. Kousei kept that bond with his brother more secretive.

While Kousei was showered with affection and expectations to one day lead the Inumaki clan, Mogaku, though treated with civility, was never fully embraced, perpetuating a sense of estrangement within the household.

The only image he can recall from this age would be a serene image of Meoto Iwa, the iconic wedded rocks, standing steadfast amidst the tranquil waters, their weathered surfaces etched with the passage of time, yet united in an eternal embrace beneath the vast expanse of the sky by a thick rope. Something Kousei didn’t see in this warped family.

# Middle Childhood
After witnessing Mogaku harness the eerie power of his cursed speech technique, Kousei found himself enveloped in an unsettling silence. The once lively atmosphere between the two now felt stifled, as if the very air carried a weighty secret. Kousei couldn't help but wonder if Mogaku harboured resentment toward him for reasons he couldn't yet comprehend. 

Months passed, marked by an uneasy tension between the brothers. Amidst the pristine halls of his new school, Kousei encountered a group of bullies tormenting his friend and himself. But as the situation escalated, a surge of unfamiliar energy coursed through Kousei's body, igniting a searing heat within his tongue and mouth. It was a sensation akin to consuming the world's spiciest chilli pepper, yet infinitely more intense. In that moment of agony, Kousei felt a primal power awaken within him, begging to be unleashed. With a guttural roar, he commanded the bullies to "Blast Away!"

A shockwave of pure force erupted from Kousei's voice, propelling the bullies back with such ferocity that they collided and went through the nearest wall. The sickening sound of impact echoed through the air as their bodies crumpled, and bones crackled with stable fractures.

As the dust settled, Kousei stood trembling, his hands still tingling with residual energy as he wrapped them around his throat. It was then that he realised the true nature of his brother's silence. Mogaku's sacrifice wasn't born out of resentment but of necessity, a self-imposed exile to protect others from the dangerous power lurking within. He can still recall the images of the kids including his friend mortified at what Kousei had done. A new clan head for the Inumaki was announced.

# Late Childhood
From the moment Kousei drew his first breath, his existence bore the weight of expectation in the eyes of his family. Born into a lineage overshadowed by the illustrious Big Three Families of Jujutsu, the Inumaki have been deemed outlaws, relegated to the fringes of the Jujutsu society. After his awakening, Kousei was viewed not as a child to be nurtured but as a tool, a means to an end for the ambitions of his clan.

Despite being raised in an environment of opulence and prestige, Kousei's upbringing resembled anything but a typical childhood. Instead, it was a relentless barrage of demands and obligations, a relentless march towards fulfilling the grand aspirations of the Inumaki clan. From the tender age when other children were allowed to frolic and explore, Kousei was burdened with a hellish weight of responsibility that crushed any semblance of innocence.

Upon awakening to his cursed speech ability, the clamour within his family and clan reached a fever pitch. They wasted no time in seizing the opportunity to mould Kousei into a formidable jujutsu sorcerer, a weapon to be honed in their image. The training regimen was relentless: gruelling drills, relentless practical exams, and endless hours devoted to refining his cursed speech till he was drowning in throat medicine, all while grappling with the unfathomable power simmering within him. 


The spark of youth, that carefree exuberance so innate to children, was extinguished by the relentless pursuit of the family's dreams. The current status of the Clan was not promising among the clan members since the new clan head was announced, seeing the current head as a strong individual but with little drive. Making his training forever more unending to utter perfection, nothing less was acceptable. Yet, amidst the suffocating pressure, Kousei found solace in the quiet determination of his older half-brother, Mogaku. Seeing Mogaku labouring in secret to perfect his abilities, Kousei realised that he wasn't truly alone in this arduous journey.

# Early Teens
The fruits of his relentless practice and training began to blossom, unfurling like the petals of a rare flower in full bloom. It was during these formative years that Kousei truly began to shine, emerging as a prodigious talent in the realm of jujutsu. Each painstaking hour spent honing his skills bore testament to his unwavering dedication and unyielding resolve. Now rumours of the current Clan Head taking on a drinking problem towards the title of becoming an alcoholic began to spread, calling her unreliable and irresponsible. They were eager to have her replaced sooner rather than later.

Yet, amidst the clamour of his burgeoning success, Kousei found himself drawn to the peaceful world of secret training sessions with Mogaku. Hidden away from prying eyes and the oppressive expectations of their clan, these sessions became a sanctuary, a crucible where their bond as brothers and comrades flourished. Together, Kousei and Mogaku delved into the intricacies of combat, exploring new fighting strategies and tactics that transcended the conventional teachings of their clan. In the dim light of their training grounds, they spared and strategized, each exchanging a symphony of motion and technique.

But perhaps the most profound aspect of their secret meetings was the development of a unique form of communication born out of necessity. Unable to speak freely, Kousei and Mogaku turned to sign language as their silent tongue. With deft movements of their hands and fingers, they conveyed thoughts, strategies, and emotions with a fluidity and precision that belied their youth. Picking up Mogaku’s Safety Word Chart for communication with others without time to learn sign language.

# Middle Teens
Kousei found himself standing at the threshold of a new chapter in his journey as a jujutsu sorcerer. Enrolled as a first-year student at Kyoto Technical College, alongside his brother Mogaku, Kousei was poised to embark on a path of discovery and growth unlike any other. The first example of this was during the entrance exam when Kousei and his brother confronted a daunting two-headed Grade 3 curse. While Kousei protected his brother, he singlehandedly faced the curse with remarkable ease. Despite a brief slip into violent tendencies, his performance left a lasting impression on the higher-ups, who praised his exceptional abilities and impressive curse energy levels.

At the start it was challenging to connect with his peers at Kyoto Technical College due to his struggle with his cursed speech, often feeling isolated and misunderstood. However, he formed a strong bond with Gyomei, who learned from Kousei about his unique technique. However, Kousei’s first mission with his squadmates, exorcising a semi-grade 2 grasshopper curse, revealed visible flaws in their teamwork that made their efforts more of a struggle. 

Upon meeting the clan head of the Inumaki clan, Eiko, Kousei initially found his perceptions challenged as rumours painted her as a lazy and irresponsible leader. However, their encounter revealed a woman of depth and authenticity, her openness and genuine concern for the clan's well-being shattering his preconceptions. Eiko's candid demeanour left a lasting impression on Kousei, fostering admiration for her resilience and understanding.
