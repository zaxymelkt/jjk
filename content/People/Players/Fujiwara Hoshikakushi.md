# Early Childhood

Fujiwara Hoshikakushi was born in [[Semboku City|Semboku]], Japan, a small city—with a population of around 26,000. With a rough population density of 29.8 people every square kilometre, Fujiwara Hoshikakushi would have to travel over 200 kilometres to meet another sorcerer like himself. Had fate not decided otherwise, Hoshikakushi would have been alone.

Born to the [[Jujutsu Historical & Prominent Families#Fujiwara|Fujiwara Clan]], Hoshikakushi had twelve siblings, born in the middle of all of them. Until Hoshikakushi’s birth and later [[Fujiwara Emiko]]’s, the family had yet to birth a sorcerer with an innate technique. Hoshikakushi’s technique is [[Shrine]], once held by the same man who massacred his clan in the Heian Era.

In the sorcerer world, rumours that the Fujiwara Clan hasn’t birthed an innate technique for three generations have become common.

Of his family, Hoshikakushi had many siblings: [[Fujiwara Hotaru|Hotaru]], [[Fujiwara Yoshitsune|Yoshitsune]], [[Fujiwara Sadako|Sadako]], [[Fujiwara Heitaro|Heitaro]], [[Fujiwara Tadahiro|Tadahiro]], [[Fujiwara Hinata|Hinata]], [[Fujiwara Ayame|Ayame]], [[Fujiwara Emiko|Emiko]], [[Fujiwara Kazuki|Kazuki]], [[Fujiwara Haruki|Haruki]], [[Fujiwara Sakura|Sakura]], [[Fujiwara Kaito|Kaito]]. Only four of his siblings became sorcerers. Hoshikakushi’s eldest sibling is 20-years-old, his youngest sibling is 9-years-old. His younger sister, Fujiwara Emiko, possesses a different innate technique than himself.

Fujiwara Hoshikakushi had one friend. How they met, no one knows for certainty. Fujiwara Emiko states, “He saved him from wolves!” Fujiwara Hanji, “He offered him some food, and he stuck around.” Hoshikakushi never comments on when their friendship started or even when they met. The only confirmed truth is that they met sometime before his sixth birthday. His friend’s name is [[Abe Toma]].

# Middle Childhood

Awakening his innate technique, [[Shrine]], at the age of six, his introduction resulted in harsh punishment towards him due to the damage he caused to the house. His ‘Shrine’ has two applications, [[Shrine#Cleave|Cleave]] and [[Shrine#Dismantle|Dismantle]], each having its strengths and weaknesses, but overall, it allowed him great control over close-ranged and mid-ranged combat.

As a child, Hoshikakushi would study [[Combat Mastery | Martial Arts]]. He would show adept skill in [[Statistics#C.E Output [C.E.O]|Output]], [[Statistics#C.E Efficiency [C.E.E]||Efficiency]], and [[Statistics#C.E Control [C.E.C]||Control]]. Those who trained with him often described that he never seemed to ‘understand’ the concepts or teachings, or rather, Hoshikakushi would ‘mimic’ them until he ‘came across’ the solution. It would work for him in the starting stage of training — swinging a staff isn’t tricky to do — learning to do it in movement or combat is a different skill.

In Hoshikakushi’s free time, he would practise with [[Fujiwara Emiko]] to develop their knowledge of ‘Cursed Energy’, which their Older siblings were only marginally decent at tutoring. During this time, he found little time to hang out with [[Abe Toma]]; however, Hoshikakushi has admitted he enjoys their time together.

# Late Childhood

As Hoshikakushi continued his study, he found Ju Jitsu to be unfitting with his methodology. At this stage in his life, he focused on defensive combat, only wanting to fight if he must — moving away from pursuing the life of jujutsu. It was a coincidence that he came across a lone Wing Chun dojo that advertised being modified to fit ‘street fighting’ and being closer to an open palm Karate than its origin.

He didn’t attend the dojo for long, only having the summer free to be that far from home. During this time, his sensei told him,

"Combat isn't inherently violent. Fighters articulate themselves through their battles, striving to defend something meaningful — even if it's a self-serving motive like wealth or status. Engaging in combat for the sake of combat is violence; if one must fight, let it be to safeguard, not to inflict harm."

Hoshikakushi, he understood what his sensei was attempting to tell him. However, it was a mute point towards the boy. He had something to protect, it was the only reason he bothered to go along with the Fujiwara’s wishes and be a sorcerer, an assassin. His aversion to the career extends to his younger siblings, going so far as to make a binding vow with his elder’s to spare his siblings from being forced to become or be one; what they asked in return is unknown to even Hoshikakushi.

# Early Teens

Since beginning public school after their family had moved to Kyoto, Hoshikakushi would frequently find himself in trouble due to fighting the other boys and intimidating the girls. Hoshikakushi’s defence was that they were bullying his little sister [[Fujiwara Emiko]]. Oddly, those not in fear of him, were infatuated with his speech pattern, but his distant attitude and gaze kept most away.

What seemed to confuse Hoshikakushi most was seeing [[Abe Toma]] arrive at the very same school, not that he minded; Abe Toma was convenient to have around, good company. He looked back upon his early promise with Abe Toma, “We’ll remain friends, even in death”, he wondered if that would have made it a ‘binding vow’.

As time went on, the fights Hoshikakushi found himself in began to slowly escalate. There had begun rumours of the damage inflicted upon others without a single punch thrown. Some began to mention how hitting Hoshikakushi felt like punching cement, and his fists felt like a bat However, Hoshikakushi never wanted to fight or mangle, but almost out of instinct, he couldn’t control it, his [[Cursed Energy Properties|Cursed Energy]] imbued into energy punch.

During middle school Hoshikakushi would gain the nickname “四条の人間の刃”. Outside of Abe Toma and Fujiwara Emiko, all the other students knew him as Kujou Reien the man who spoke poetics.

# Middle Teens

## Part 1

### Incident

If Hoshikakushi stopped at minor bouts, he may have ended up never a part of [[Kyoto Metropolitan Curse Technical College|Jujutsu High in Kyoto]]. Fortunately or unfortunately, he didn’t stop at a mere beating after years of dealing with both his home and school life. A boy named [[Yuo Hatetsu]] found himself to be the first victim of [[Shrine]], him lacking the ability to see cursed energy, the injuries inflicted appeared as if a divine force invoked them. While the school couldn’t prove the incident that mutilated Yuo and his friends was caused by Hoshikakushi, he was still expelled.

His difficulties would pile on, his father alerting him to the death of his two [[Fujiwara Yoshitsune]] and [[Fujiwara Tadahiro]], his older brothers along with the comatose status of his [[Fujiwara Sadako|older sister]]. This pushed him further down the spiral of protection, his feelings stronger than ever. Perhaps if his siblings never died, he would have taken his execution over enrolment.

### Consequences

The specifics are unknown, but Hoshikakushi was made to join the Kyoto School along with his Little Sister [[Fujiwara Emiko|Emiko]], sparing him from the execution he expected and was prepared for. Coincidentally, at least, in Hoshikakushi’s mind, [[Abe Toma]] was enrolled as well.

It’s difficult to say if Hoshikakushi felt remorse for his actions, he was difficult to read normally. Privately, he didn’t, whether to protect himself or justify it, his brain believed the boy and his friends were ‘not innocent’ due to their acts and as a result their injuries were justified.

## Part 2

### Arrival

Hoshikakushi arrived at Kyoto Curse Technical College with his little sister Fujiwara Emiko. The two were registered with their new names, “Kujou Reien” and “Kanoe Kasumu” respectively. Hoshikakushi would have to give up his name irregardless, but he felt his sister did it out of respect for their late brother. Their time at the school was immediately filled with violence and alarm; made to combat a grade three curse, known as “[[Arms Curse|Arms]]”, luckily together. With minor difficulty, the two dealt and captured the curse.

Soon after, Reien would meet an old friend, Abe Toma. He always seemed to appear some way or another. The two talked and enjoyed their alone time, before being interrupted by a member of the [[Zen'in Isao|Zen’in clan]] and a boy born outside of sorcery. Inoue [[Inoe Riku|Riku]] and his “wife” [[Inoe Riku#Miyo|Miyo]], were reliable in Reien’s mind, but Hoshikakushi’s opinion was less favourable. Riku would get the chance to show himself during a mission alongside Reien and Kasumu.

### Minoh Radio Tower

Fujiwara Hoshikakushi was tasked alongside [[Fujiwara Emiko]], [[Inoe Riku]], [[Abe Toma]], and [[Hoshika Kiara]] to investigate the [[Minoh City|City of Minoh]] due to a mass sweep of unexplained disappearances. Arriving on the outskirts of the city, the group decided to head toward the old [[Minoh City#Radio Tower|Radio Tower]] as the sewer seemed like a less favourable option.

Arriving at the Radio Tower, Hoshikakushi instructed his group to stand away from him besides Toma. Hoshikakushi would collapse the radio tower on the curses that lived inside — along with the dead humans which they had kept. Immediately after, Toma would release a Frost Calm on the remaining; eliminating a majority of a the threat they faced, leaving them with only the strongest to deal with. One curse, [[Cursed Spirits#Takizawa|Takizawa]], was the first to face the party.

The curse was incredibly fast and had the ability to shift its limbs into different weapons. Through Toma's cursed technique, the curse's speed was slowed, allowing for Hoshikakushi and Riku's Miyo to face against the curse. Hoshikakushi was forced to deal with Takizawa alone at one point as another, far scarier and powerful curse, appeared taking the focus of Hoshika and Riku.

Emiko followed her brother's commands to stay back and assist with long-range attacks. However, during Hoshikakushi's battle against Takizawa, after unleashing the utmost of martial arts, he was stricken to near death.

During his time within a near death state, Hoshikakushi found himself within his [[Fujiwara Hoshikakushi#Innate Domain|innate domain]]. He looked around, feeling the world around him slowly crumble with each faint whimper of regret. He was alone all but for his persona ‘Reien’, looking down upon him.
“Even in death, seeing only oneself 
 Wearing ancient garments, speaking ancient words 
 Concealing ancient sorcery within calamity.”

When he woke, he was in the school's infirmary. Though his essence was largely unchanged from before, a spectral fragment of his being lingered in the realm of the departed.

## Part 3

### Minoh Sewers

Fujiwara Hoshikakushi found himself along side [[Zen'in Isao]], [[Gojo Tatsuki]], and [[Fujiwara Emiko|Kanoe Kasumu]] on a return mission to [[Minoh City]] in order to investigate and exterminate the curse epidemic.

Hoshikakushi and his fellow sorcerers made their way to the [[Minoh City#Sewers|City sewers]] where they were met with an a structure made of curse and flesh. The walls of the sewers were covered by an amalgamation, it was [[Cursed Spirits#Wall Curse|the Wall Curse]].

The curses that inhabited the [[Minoh City#Radio Tower|City Ratio Tower]] and the sewers were a hive mind controlled by [[Saiko|Special Grade Curse Saiko]]. They appeared to be created using living and dead humans, converting them completely into curses.

During his battles Hoshikakushi used his newly developed [[Shrine#Cleave SpiderWeb|extension technique, Cleave : SpiderWeb]] in order to cause massive damage to the Wall Curse. He'd combat against smaller curses alongside Isao in order to clear way to the hive-mind centre.

Once arrived at the control centre of the sewer system, Hoshikakushi would engage in combat against [[Guardians of Minoh|Guardian of Minoh Curse Spirit]] with the initial assistance of Isao before having to handle the beast on his own once Isao used his Domain Expansion; until Tatsuki arrived to take over the fight, allowing Hoshikakushi time to recover from the multitude of injuries he sustained.

Due to the actions of Isao, the Cursed Womb prematurely awoken, giving rise to Saiko's birth. During this time and Hoshikakushi's battle with the Grade 2 Cursed Spirit, Emiko would discover [[Hadashi Matsuda]] who was seemingly captive to the transmutation into a cursed spirit — luckily, Emiko managed to retrieve him before the process could take lasting affect.

### Goodwill Event

The Goodwill Event is hosted between students of [[Kyoto Metropolitan Curse Technical College]] and [[Tokyo Metropolitan Curse Technical College]] where to students face one another in jujutsu sorcery. Hoshikakushi was joined by [[Nakamura Shinji]] during the event. Their opponent was [[Isae Mukuro]]

#### Nakamura, Fujiwara vs Isae

Arriving on time to the event, Shinji and Hoshikakushi were met with Isae Mukuro. The dynamic between the three was strange for the event they find themselves in; none wished to actually fight, in fact, Hoshikakushi was incredibly interested in playing a game of baseball with Mukuro. However, Shinji and soon Mukuro came around to the requirement of their battle. Hoshikakushi, reluctantly joined in, without confidence in their success.

Their battle was intense but short lived. Mukuro began the assault

#### Goodwill Interruption | Q Raid

- [[Q]] attacks [[Gojo Tatsuki]] the holder of the six eyes. Tatsuki dies. Tatsuki revives.

### D/CE Auction

#### Preparation

Before the invasion of the [[D-CE|D/CE]] auction, Hoshikakushi would be with many of the [[Kyoto Metropolitan Curse Technical College]] staff and a few students who remained loyal to the school and did not attend the auction with their great families.

It was there Hoshikakushi was made to get a new outfit from Mukuro, managing himself a fairly fancy, though traditional-enough, outfit.

He'd discuss with the others a plan of action, though it never appeared to him that they had a sound plan; but he would make due regardless. Riku would stay back with a few others to act as a last resort option if things went sour. Hoshikakushi would be joined primarily with Emiko and Shinji; the three of them making their way inside with Arisa Arima and two others.

Once inside, they would further discuss the plan quietly. The three of them would quickly make their way down to the basement of the Auction building in order to steal the Back of the Prison realm, amongst other personal items.

Outside of his goal with the school, to protect his little sister; Hoshikakushi was also at the auction to learn key information for his clan, the Fujiwara. As a member of the Moon Branch, he had no other choice was prioritise this to some extent or face repercussions.

#### Nakamura, Fujiwara vs Ichikawa

Arriving at the basement, the group would find a door to be all that stood in their way of where D/CE kept the auctioning item. The door was slightly opened, swaying on the cautious side, Hoshikakushi rolled something through the opening before the group was met face to face with a blood covered [[Ichikawa Arata]], the Demon King. Hoshikakushi was thrown off, the man completely lacked Cursed Energy.

[[Nakamura Shinji]] was quick to attack the man as he attempted to close the door. Taking a quick moment, Hoshikakushi orders Emiko to create a barrier to disallow others from entering while he created a barrier to block the Kogane communication. immediately after, he joined Shinji in the assault against Ichikawa.

Standing proud, Hoshikakushi announces with the Enma Palm Sign, "[[Domain Expansion - Kāmadhātu Shrine]]" releasing his [[Domain Expansion - Kāmadhātu Shrine#Incomplete|Incomplete Domain]] encasing the room they were in. Immediately, his attack was made — a large gash appearing on Ichikawa's remaining arm.

Their battle continued, rapidly Ichikawa warmed up while Hoshikakushi destroyed the room around them to allow his class mates to find the cursed tool they were searching for. Amidst the battle, Emiko's Arm's curse found the [[Chain of a Thousand Miles]] tossing it to Hoshikakushi. However, it was short lived for him. Ichikawa had enough of Hoshikakushi's threat, slashing him beyond self-repair. Hoshikakushi Died.

Shinji's witness to Hoshikakushi's death, a man who had put his trust in him had fallen, something within Shinji, the remnant of his cursed energy sparked — awakening his potential.

#### Acknowledgement of Calamity

In death, there are short moments where a person reflect on their life, sucked into their innate domain — a battle of will; to remain alive or to pass on. Hoshikakushi was no stranger to this, he was familiar with the despair of his innate domain. His innate domain was a realm of profound solitude and isolation, an abyss where the echoes of his thoughts reverberated endlessly against unseen walls. Within this desolate expanse, darkness reigned supreme, swallowing any semblance of light that dared to intrude. It was a place where time seemed to lose its meaning, each moment stretching into an eternity of introspection and contemplation.

Talismanic symbols adorned the space like scattered whispers of forgotten magic, their significance lost to the void but their presence palpable, casting an eerie aura over the domain. Each glyph seemed to pulsate with a silent energy, warding off intruders and reinforcing the barrier between him and the shrine of his family's engravings. Through the opaque glass wall, he could faintly discern the outlines of the shrine, a sacred sanctuary containing the cherished memories and legacies of his lineage. Yet, despite its proximity, it remained tantalisingly out of reach, separated from him by an insurmountable divide.

It was there, Hoshikakushi met [[Master Tengen]]. She reached a hand out to him, commanding him to stand and listen to her words. Hoshikakushi, through their conversation regained his composure and will for life — learning the truth about his family and why he was born with his innate technique. In this time, he learned that [[Fujiwara Fuyutsuga|Lord Fuyutsuga]], made a vow with Tengen to disregard his family's power until a soul was born capable of holding the calamity that is the Essence of Ryomen Sukuna, the King of Curses; the first Calamity.

Hoshikakushi pondered on the information before rejecting it. Asserting that he the one who determines his will, his destiny, the one who will shape the world however he desires. He announced to her, "I'll be the upheaval the clan yearns for, the tempest of my own making. Only my longing remains."

His time with Tengen was cut short.

#### Return of Calamity

As the battle neared its end, the awakened Shinji and his younger sister Emiko unleashed their final onslaught against Ichikawa. Shinji, with a lethal combination of moves, summoned the full extent of his power, while Emiko, in her debut attack, manifested her fire-arrow ability. Their combined assault left Ichikawa's chances of survival in ashes, rendering him nearly defenceless against their onslaught.

Following her arrow's release, Emiko swiftly moved to Hoshikakushi, her hands glowing with the intent to heal his grievous wounds and reignite his fading heartbeat. Through her efforts, Hoshikakushi was pulled back from the brink of death, teetering on the edge of life, his willpower the only force guiding him towards recovery.

Upon regaining a mere glimmer of his vitality, Hoshikakushi stirred, enveloping the room in a dense, malevolent aura of cursed energy. The oppressive weight of his energy bore down on everything around him. Hoshikakushi appeared altered, as if a portion of his being had remained in the realm of the dead.
