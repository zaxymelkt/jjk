# Early Childhood
Hailing from a prestigious family of swordsmen, Riku never really had much of a break. Constantly being berated and expected to do better. His parents often pestered him about something weird, asking if he was able to see something yet, still not capable of properly understanding what they meant by this. Although on the more quiet side, he had quite a few friends and admirers, likely a result of his lineage as he had participated in countless tournaments with him always being a top contender. This constantly bothered him and caused the boy to develop a sense of distrust in others around him, often believing others to be wanting something from him, rather than seeing him as an actual person.
# Middle Childhood
But this would all soon change… After meeting a certain girl. One day during a surprise meeting, Riku was forced into an arranged marriage against his will. But this would turn out to be the change that would change his life forever. The girl he ended up meeting was Miyo Tsuchinori. At first, it was the same thing he was used to, Miyo said she agreed with the marriage and all that, which Riku was under the pressure of accepting as well. With the obligation placed upon him, he didn’t get much of a choice. But upon speaking in private Miyo specifically told him to his face that she didn’t plan on having any future or life with him. She simply agreed to the marriage so her own parents would stop bothering her, something Riku could sympathize with. And with that, the newly engaged couple would be living together under the same roof.
# Late Childhood
At first, it was very unsatisfactory as the two constantly clashed when it came to living together, both having different values on the matter. But after spending more time with each other, the pair started to realize and understand each other's preferences and stopped bothering each other. Eventually getting to the point that they actually started enjoying each other's company. With time, they became extremely close. Especially after a particular incident with Miyo being kidnapped by a group of criminals using her as a bargain for money. But without a moment of hesitation, the boy bursted and forced his way through the facility, fighting his way through. But this was no normal criminal organization, which pushed Riku to his very limits. Unconsciously awakening his usage of Curse Energy for the first time. But due to him not being able to control it whatsoever, it placed quite an intense strain on his body. Causing the boy to collapse in Miyo’s arms after successfully saving her.
# Early Teens
Since that incident, Riku and Miyo have finally officially become a real couple as they indeed fell in love with each other after such a long time. Constantly being together, the two often do what they can to please each other. Truly a wholesome romance. Even reaching the point where they exchanged rings to symbolize their love for each other. Having the time of their lives, Riku truly felt happy and believed that he indeed made the right choice in accepting her as his fiancé. But all good things must end. Resulting in the event that completely devastated him. While he was in one of his usual tournaments, his house ended up being set on fire by the same group of criminals from all those years ago. Upon returning home, Riku would find that everything he had been working for had perished… It was all taken from him in an instant. His life flashed before his eyes as he cried in pain and agony in front of his beloved. The emotion being so great that he would unintentionally curse and resurrect Miyo as a cursed spirit.
# Middle Teens
After that day, Riku had never been able to return to his original self, constantly grieving about the loss of his beloved and moreover… Now having her as a cursed spirit haunting him for the rest of his life. To be completely honest, at one point he made an attempt to end it all, for Miyo to halt him in his tracks. And with that, the boy was forced into attending a certain school at the request of his parents.
