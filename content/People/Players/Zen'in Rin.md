# Early Childhood
Born on June 4th at 8 o'clock, Rin Zen'in was the result of a chance encounter between Sakura Hatori, a human woman working in Tokyo's red-light district, and Kenji Zen'in, a sorcerer from the famed Zen'in clan. This union, marked by a night of celebration and alcohol, led to Rin's conception. However, Kenji was absent during Rin's birth, leaving Sakura to raise Rin alone. The only physical reminder of Kenji's paternity was a small heart-shaped birthmark above Rin's hip.

Sakura, despite being young and struggling financially, did her best to provide for Rin. However, the challenges of single parenthood, coupled with Rin's unique ability to perceive supernatural entities, placed significant strain on their relationship. As Rin grew older, her visions of monsters and otherworldly beings became more frequent, leading to increased isolation and difficulty in social interactions.
# Middle Childhood
Rin's childhood was marked by bullying and academic struggles, exacerbated by her inability to concentrate due to the constant presence of perceived threats. Around the age of six, Rin began to manifest her technique, further complicating her life. Despite her mother's efforts to comfort her, Rin's descriptions of her encounters with these entities were so vivid and realistic that Sakura began to doubt whether they were merely imaginary friends.

As Rin entered her middle childhood, she withdrew socially, finding solace in silence. The pressure of her experiences led to mental health issues, including panic attacks and breakdowns. At the age of twelve, Rin attempted suicide, but was interrupted by a manifestation of her technique, revealing the reality of her perceptions.
# Late Childhood
Following her near-suicide, Rin experienced a profound shift in perspective. The intervention of her technique during her suicide attempt suggested that the entities she saw were not mere hallucinations. This realization prompted Rin to take a break from school and begin a deeper investigation into her abilities.

During this period, Rin encountered Aki, a Jujutsu Sorcerer, who introduced her to the world of sorcery. Aki recognized Rin's potential and informed the Zen'in clan about her, leading to an offer from the clan to train and protect Rin. Sakura agreed to this arrangement, hoping it would provide Rin with opportunities she lacked in Tokyo.
# Early Teens
With the support of the Zen'in clan, Rin's life took a dramatic turn. She was formally introduced to her father, Kenji, and began her training under the clan's guidance. Despite initial enthusiasm, Kenji proved to be indifferent towards Rin, delegating her care to others. Rin's training focused on developing her technique, with limited personal interaction or emotional support.

Rin's early teens were characterized by rigorous training and the beginning of her formal education at the Tokyo Academy. The move was presented as an honor, but Rin suspected it was a way for Kenji to distance himself from her. Regardless, Rin embraced the challenge, using the opportunity to hone her skills and explore her potential as a sorcerer.
# Middle Teens
By the age of sixteen, Rin had established herself as a formidable sorcerer-in-training. Her unique technique, initially seen as a curiosity, was now recognized for its power and potential. Despite the lack of genuine connection with her father, Rin found solace in her training and the companionship of Aki, who remained a supportive figure in her life.

Rin's journey from a troubled child to a promising sorcerer was fraught with challenges and loneliness. Yet, through perseverance and the support of those few who genuinely cared for her, Rin navigated the complexities of her heritage and the responsibilities that came with her powers.
