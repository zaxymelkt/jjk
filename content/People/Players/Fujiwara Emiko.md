# Early Childhood
Born in [[Semboku City|Semboku]], Japan, a small city which has a population of around 26,000 people. With a rough population density of 29.8 people every square kilometre, Fujiwara Emiko would have to travel over 200 kilometres to meet another sorcerer like herself.

Born to the Fujiwara Clan, Emiko had twelve siblings, born close to last out of all of them. Until [[Fujiwara Hoshikakushi]]’s birth and later her own, the family had yet to birth a sorcerer with an innate technique. Emiko’s innate technique is ‘[[Curse Manipulation]]’. 

It is said that the Fujiwara hasn’t birthed an innate technique for 3 generations.

Of her family, Emiko had many siblings: [[Fujiwara Hotaru|Hotaru]], [[Fujiwara Yoshitsune|Yoshitsune]], [[Fujiwara Sadako|Sadako]], [[Fujiwara Heitaro|Heitaro]], [[Fujiwara Tadahiro|Tadahiro]], [[Fujiwara Hinata|Hinata]], [[Fujiwara Ayame|Ayame]], [[Fujiwara Hoshikakushi|Hoshikakushi]], [[Fujiwara Kazuki|Kazuki]], [[Fujiwara Haruki|Haruki]], [[Fujiwara Sakura|Sakura]], [[Fujiwara Kaito|Kaito]]. Only four of his siblings became sorcerers. Hoshikakushi’s eldest sibling is 20-years-old, his youngest sibling is 9-years-old. Her older brother Fujiwara Hoshikakushi possesses a different innate technique than herself.
# Middle Childhood
Upon awakening her innate technique "[[Cursed Manipulation]]' at the age of seven, her introduction to the technique resulted in a rather odd form of praise due to her releasing others of their weighing emotions. Her "Curse Manipulation' has two clauses, 1: You may take control over curses that are either placed into a near death state or forcing it into a state of fear that removes it's supernatural protection and 2: To claim a cursed spirit that is controlled by another, you must kill them before doing so. While these clauses may prove to be difficult to manage Emiko has found fear to be her more favoured factor.

As a child, Emiko looked up to her older brother Hoshikakushi as the first innate technique user in three generations, so as one who idolised their brother would do she followed strictly in his footsteps studying Jiu Jitsu, Kendo, Sojutsu, Bojutsu, and Kyujutsu. As someone with her technique she trained hard to master her skill in [[Statistics#C.E Control [C.E.C]|Cursed Energy Control]], [[Statistics#C.E Efficiency [C.E.E]|Efficiency]], and [[Statistics#C.E Output [C.E.O]|Output]] alongside her brother, as her brother mastered most of these practices before her she watched closely learning from him how to use each skill. Though from his training to hers it seemed Emiko's was a tad bit more refined as she took the time to read the teachings and understand exactly how her arms should move correctly.

The time Emiko spent with Hoshikakushi during his free time was something she quite enjoyed, she was able to practise her to develop their knowledge of '[[Statistics#Cursed Energy Stats|Cursed Energy]]' together, something she didn't care much to learn from their Older siblings as they weren't exactly on the same level of understanding as Emiko.
