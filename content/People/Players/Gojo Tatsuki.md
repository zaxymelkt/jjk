# Early Childhood
Tatsuki grew up in the esteemed Gojo clan. There isn’t much to be said about his childhood, neither of his parents were extremely notable figures or anything in the Gojo clan, or even in Jujutsu Society in general. Though, as a young boy he did develop the basic skills of Limitless, passed down throughout the Gojo clan.
# Middle Childhood
He was trained to be a great Sorcerer, but never really cared much about his studies in that department. He didn’t have any friends at all really except for the occasional acquaintance on the playground, nothing long-lasting though.
# Late Childhood
Upon entering middle school, Tatsuki’s grades really started slipping, almost flunking out of the 7th Grade like an idiot. His parents scolded him for this, but that did nothing. It wasn’t until the final week of 8th Grade that Tatsuki realised, if he wanted to go to a Jujutsu High School, he still had to pass Middle School.
# Early Teens
In the final week of his 8th Grade year, he instantly got every one of his grades up to straight A’s or above, proving that he was simply being lazy throughout school and could pass if he tried.
# Middle Teens
Months before enrolling into Kyoto Tech, the Gojo clan started paying attention to Tatsuki a lot more. This was because it was revealed that Tatsuki was somewhat of a generational anomaly, he had unlocked the power of the Six Eyes, a technique that only appeared within the Gojo Clan once in a generation. From then on, Tatsuki’s confidence grew larger and larger, and the clan gained a new hope once again. It had never been heard of that a member of the Gojo Clan would unlock the Six Eyes at the age of 16, usually the person would be born with it, though nobody was complaining, the excitement of a new [[Six Eyes]] user was overwhelming.
