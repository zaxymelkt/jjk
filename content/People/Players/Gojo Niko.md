# Early Childhood
Niko was born to Yua and Ren Gojo on July 8th at 8:15 PM. As the youngest child, she faced constant comparisons to her older brother Yuta, who possessed the legendary Six Eyes and was more skilled with his cursed technique. This early pressure to make the clan proud and match or exceed her brother's abilities weighed heavily on her.
# Middle Childhood
At the age of 6, Niko began showing signs of the Limitless Technique, marking the start of her formal training. Despite not being the favorite child, a memorable moment occurred when her mother took her out for sushi after she accidentally used Infinity during a game. This outing was significant as it was one of the rare instances where her mother showed genuine interest in her.
# Late Childhood
The relationship between Niko and Yuta remained strained throughout their childhood. They mostly avoided each other, viewing each other as obstacles. Academically, Niko performed adequately, though she was not outstanding. Her focus increasingly shifted towards mastering her cursed technique, driven by the desire for recognition and acceptance.
# Early Teens
Tragedy struck when Yuta was killed at the age of 14 during a battle against a third-year student, an event known as the "Deathwalk." His death profoundly affected the family, especially her father, Ren, whose spirit seemed broken. Niko found herself taking on more responsibilities, particularly caring for her grieving mother, which fostered her independence.
# Middle Teens
Following Yuta's death, the expectations placed on Niko intensified. She was expected to surpass her deceased brother's achievements, a burden she resented. Feeling suffocated by these expectations and the constant comparisons, Niko decided to leave home without leaving a note. Seeking freedom and a chance to define herself on her own terms, she enrolled in Jujutsu High at the age of 15. There, she began rebelling against her upbringing by adopting tattoos, piercings, and smoking, determined to succeed not for her family's sake, but out of sheer defiance.
