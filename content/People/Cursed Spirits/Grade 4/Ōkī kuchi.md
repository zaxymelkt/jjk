This curse is said to originate from a collective feeling of paranoia, anxiety, and untrust towards others. Found commonly within school locker rooms, the spaces between cubicles in any major office space, and the exterior fencing of playgrounds. The concept that others are speaking ill of you, assumptions of the worst being whispered into your ear, magnified as both your shoulders start to sink and feel heavy, taking this curse with you into the outer world. This curse takes the shape of two totem-like cylinders, with their only point of articulation being their jaw, allowing them to speak.

| **Unique Traits:**<br><br>1. Although this Cursed Spirit takes two forms, it is considered to be a single entity. The two Tiki-like entities share one single soul, as well as one Health Pool. If anyone speaks directly into one of the Ōkī kuchi, the other will perfectly mimic their voice, creating a strange form of communication between up to two parties.<br>2. The Curse Manipulation user can choose to summon a single totem at a time, this does not incur any cost until the second totem is summoned. |
