This curse is born from the collective cowardice of a population, often found in packs grubbing at the feet of troops lined up in trenches, crawling along the backs of those who are too scared to speak up in a desperate situation. Taking the form of a grub-like creature, about the length of a young man's arm, it has a cream-coloured body with a red face and set of tiny, blunted legs of which it drags itself along the ground, skittering often at the first sign of danger.

In response to danger or a threat, Aka Koshinuke will release a heavy red smog, taking up a 3x3x3 Meter space around themselves, this field of smog heavily obscures the sight of everyone who enters it, blinding them for anything not within 0.5 Meters of them. |
