He is smarter than the average human, capable in hand-to-hand combat, and a refuser of 'human' filthy tools. An expert in offensive combat, Ko-Guy stands as the pinnacle of Semi-Grade 1 curses.

| Unique Traits:<br><br>1. Ko-Guy must molt regularly as he grows, once per RP, Ko-Guy can over the course of 2 turns molt his exoskeleton, leaving behind a carbon copy of his visage. This copy is capable of tricking those who look at it, anyone with Reaction less than his own believes this to be Ko-Guy, and will react to his attacks as though they had the ‘dazed’ condition. Once they see the real Ko-Guy, they are no longer convinced of the illusion. <br>    <br>2. This Curse has proficiency 3 in the following : Offensive, Balance. And proficiency 2 in Defensive and Reactionary. Ko-Guy cannot use weapons, as weapons were developed by humans, and he is smarter than humans! Thus, he does not need to use inferior technology.<br><br>3. Ko-Guy is capable of secreting a black mucus from his throat, this stream of poison is 7 Meters long, and half a meter wide. Upon making contact with a surface, it expands outwards into a pool of 3 x 3 meters.<br>- Inflicts Poison 2 on contact.<br>    <br>- This poison remains in a target's system for 5 turns after contact.<br>    <br>- This costs 25 Cursed Energy to do, and has a 2 turn cooldown between uses. |
