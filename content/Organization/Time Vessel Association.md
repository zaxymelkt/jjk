Time Vessel Association (時ときの器うつわの会かい) is the Star Religious Group that worships [[Master Tengen]] as their deity.

The Time Vessel Association began in the [[Jujutsu History#Nara Era [Before 794]|Nara Period]] during a time when [[Master Tengen]] first began to spread Japanese Buddhism. They preached what would become the foundation for jujutsu [[Sorcerers]]. However the worlds of jujutsu and religion didn't agree and the Time Vessel Association was born from that disparity. The group maintained its monotheistic ideals all the way until the [[Jujutsu History#Modern Era [1868 - Present]|modern]] age.

By 2006, the Time Vessel Association was a wealthy religious group that operated in the underbelly of the jujutsu world. They worshipped [[Master Tengen]] as their sovereign deity referred to as the "Star" (星ほし), making the organisation officially known as the Star Religious Group (盤ばん星せい教きょう) to the public, a congregation of non-curse users that can't be targeted by jujutsu sorcerers. Followers of the faith were called Children of the Star (星ほしの子こ).
