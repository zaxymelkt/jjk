Since the beginning of Jujutsu Sorcery, clans that each have their own unique cursed abilities and techniques have existed and together, have formed what is known as Jujutsu society. Among Jujutsu society, the Three Great Families are the Kamo clan, the Gojo clan, and the Zenin Clan. These clans all have conservative values deeply instilled in them. While these values tend to clash with the values of the new generation of sorcerers, the Three Great Families are in charge of all of the lower branches (Jujutsu high schools, sorcerers, non-sorcerers, anyone involved with Jujutsu), as they pass down the laws and rules that Jujutsu society has to abide to. They are also in charge of promoting sorcerers to higher grades.

# Zen'in
---
The Zenin Clan, a formidable and combat-oriented family entrenched in the world of jujutsu, embodies an unwavering commitment to power and strength above all else. Led by individuals who adhere strictly to their traditional values, the Zenin Clan places paramount importance on sorcerous talent, often at the expense of familial bonds and ethical considerations. Within their ranks, the pursuit of power knows no bounds, and even relatives are not spared from the oppressive grasp of their ideology. Their legacy is one of self-righteousness, yet their martial prowess is undeniable when it comes to their effectiveness in exorcism. However, the zenith of their power conceals a fractured foundation, as internal dissent threatens to tear apart the very fabric of their clan.

# Kamo
---
The Kamo clan is another one of the Great Three, with similar conservative values that align with both the Zenin and Gojo clans. Each generation’s clan head has been given the name Noritoshi since the clan was established. The Kamo clan is known for their cursed techniques involving blood manipulation, which can be quite versatile and useful in combat and exorcism. Such a useful technique has allowed them to have a stronger grasp on Jujutsu society. Similar to the Zenin clan, the Kamo clan looks down upon non-sorcerers and doesn’t see any value in having them around, even if they are a spouse or parent of a clan member.

# Gojo
---
Unlike the Zenin and Kamo clans, which have various techniques among their clan members, the Gojo Clan’s prestige only relies on the individual that inherits the Six Eyes once every century or so. The Gojo clan are also descendants of the Sugawara no Michizane, one of the most well-known sorcerers of the Heian Era, otherwise known as the Golden Age of Jujutsu. The Gojo clan is also known for its Limitless technique, which is widely regarded as one of the strongest techniques in Jujutsu history.

# Inumaki
---
The Inumaki clan is not among the Great Three, and is regarded as the ‘outlaws’ of Jujutsu society, but are still quite prevalent. Furthermore, the clan has a standing policy to have jujutsu sorcerers born in the clan die out of the family tree. Few select members from the Inumaki clan wield Cursed Speech, and have proved to be formidable in combat ever since the Golden Age.  Cursed speech users are typically marked with the symbol of the Inumaki clan: Snake Eyes and Fangs sigil across their mouths.

# Fujiwara
---
For those that find interest in the history of Jujutsu and Japan they will find that during the Heian period, the Fujiwara clan rose to prominence through astute matrimonial alliances with the imperial family. By marrying their daughters into the imperial line, Fujiwara leaders seamlessly integrated into the highest echelons of power, exerting significant sway over imperial affairs. At the zenith of their influence, the Fujiwara clan effectively assumed the role of de facto rulers of Japan, manipulating key governmental positions and orchestrating the intricate workings of the imperial court from the shadows. While emperors maintained ceremonial authority, it was often Fujiwara regents who dictated the course of events.

In addition to their political dominance, the Fujiwara clan played a pivotal role in nurturing Japanese culture and the arts during the Heian period. They emerged as fervent patrons of literature, poetry, and the performing arts, nurturing the flourishing of Japanese classical culture. Despite their formidable stature, the Fujiwara clan encountered internal discord and external pressures in the late Heian period. Threats from provincial samurai clans and internal strife gradually eroded their grip on power.

Notably, within the Fujiwara clan, there existed a faction known as the Moon, Star, or Sun Progression and the 5 Void Star Generals. Sorcerers within the clan relinquished their identities to join this group of assassins, whose exploits later met their demise at the hands of Sukuna, leaving only remnants.

Nevertheless, the Fujiwara clan's indelible imprint on Japanese history and culture endures. Their profound influence during the Heian period sculpted the political and cultural landscape of Japan, bequeathing a legacy that resonates through the annals of time.

# Abe
--- 
Another clan just as pivotal as the Fujiwara is the Abe clan. The Abe family is a clan of jujutsu sorcerers that are inseparable from the history of jujutsu sorcery in Japan, and largely responsible for its spreading and principles. Most prominent in the Nara period, they are considered as the ancestors of all prominent sorcerer families today, and some of its most powerful members continue to influence jujutsu society even during modern times. However, the burden of supporting this legacy was also what led to the downfall of the Abe name during the Heian period, and consequently an immense struggle for power between all the newborn sorcerer families throughout Japan.

During the primordial period of jujutsu, the Abe family is said to be responsible for a lot of the cursed techniques that later would become commonplace among sorcerers, such as cursed barriers, cursed restrictions and shikigami. While they did not necessarily invent these techniques, they were responsible for their vulgarization and spread among the budding jujutsu society. The Abe family pushed those capable of harnessing cursed energy in Japan to new levels, challenging them like others would do in the future, creating more powerful cursed spirits and jujutsu sorcerers throughout their generations. 

The remnants of the Suguwara clan and one of the greatest sorcerers of the Heian Era known as Angel formed the Desshi Pacification Squad to fight against Sukuna alongside the Fujiwara clan. However, the Abe clan was wiped alongside them, leaving behind remnants that would go on to form the Zenin and Gojo clans.
