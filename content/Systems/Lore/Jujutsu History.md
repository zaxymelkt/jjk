# Nara Era Before 794
---

Before the Heian Era, the time periods that proceeded were the building blocks of the future of Japan, as the country became more united, beginning to deviate itself from the rest of Asia and establish its own cultures and religious practices. Not much is known about Jujutsu sorcery until the dawn of the Nara Era [710 CE - 794 CE], where exceptional sorcerers began to suddenly appear.

# Heian Era 794 - 1185
---

The Heian Era is depicted as the "Golden Age of Sorcery," the most important time period in the history of sorcery. The creation and development of new cursed techniques was at an all time high during the Heian Era. This era saw the emergence of the most powerful sorcerers and would leave a massive imprint on the future of the Jujutsu world as we know it. 

The King of Curses was the dominating factor during the Heian Era, defeating the most powerful sorcerers at the time, including the factions of the Fujiwara and Abe clans. After their defeat, the King spread his cursed energy into 20 cursed objects- his fingers-to preserve his existence beyond the Golden Age.

# Sengoku Era [1467-1618]
---

After over two-hundred years of power struggles tied into sorcery and cursed spirits, the entity known as Tengen would merge with a Star Plasma Vessel for the first time, creating a barrier that would effectively restrict both the existence of cursed energy and cursed spirits. This process would continue to be repeated once every few centuries or so to maintain the strength of the barriers and prevent unspeakable calamity.

# Edo Era 1603 – 1868
---

During the Edo era, the strongest member of the Gojo clan who wielded both the Limitless technique and the Six Eyes challenged the strongest member of the Zenin clan who wielded the Ten Shadows technique to a one-on-one deathmatch. They represented the peak of their clans, and both killed each other in a marvelous battle that one could not describe with words.

# Modern Era 1868 - Present
Nothing catastrophic has happened in the last 200 years relating to Jujutsu, thanks to Tengen’s barrier. However, a new Star Plasma Vessel was born recently, along with a user of the Six Eyes. The barrier has begun to weaken and the Star Plasma Vessel will soon need to merge with Tengen to maintain the barrier for the next few centuries, suppressing the cursedness that lies beyond.
