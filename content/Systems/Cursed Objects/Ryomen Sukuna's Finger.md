# Overview
are twenty special grade cursed objects created from the King of Curses, [[Ryomen Sukuna]]'s fingers. Using these fingers, the Heian Era curse user was able to live on after his death, eventually reincarnating through [ Redacted ] and [[Fujiwara Hoshikakushi]] over a thousand years later.

[[Ryomen Sukuna]]'s fingers are severed mummified fingers that originally belonged to Sukuna. There are a total of twenty of them, each containing the soul and fragmented power of Sukuna even after a thousand years. Each of the fingers possesses cursed energy that is equivalent to a special grade cursed spirit.

The fingers are indestructible and can only be sealed. However, even after being sealed, the fingers remain an incredible threat and continue to attract curses, growing stronger day by day. The presence of the cursed objects can vary from finger to finger, with some possessing immense auras, some others remaining hidden, and some having already been consumed by cursed spirits, which makes locating them extremely difficult. If Sukuna wished to regain his power by gathering his other fingers, his vessel could act as a radar for these cursed objects, directing them to the whereabouts of the fingers.
