# Overview

> [!warning] Scolding Chains of Hell
>  Due to being bound to the arms, the wielder also cannot be disarmed without severing the limb itself. 

- Upon striking a target, the blades drain a small portion of Cursed Energy from the opponent, increasing the strength buff of this weapon by +1 per successful hit.
	- This is a consecutive stack, maxing out at +6.
- At the cost of Strength, the blades can be swung in a wide circle around the wielder, leaving behind ardent flames in its wake.
	- The ATK STR buff cannot go lower than +3.
- This ability takes 2 action slots and has a cooldown of 3 turns.
- Depending the strength built up, the burn from the flames will increase.
	- 1 ATK STR consumed: [[Status Conditions#Burned|Burned]] 1.
	- 2 ATK STR consumed: [[Status Conditions#Burned|Burned]] 2.
	- 3 ATK STR consumed: [[Status Conditions#Burned|Burned]] 3.
