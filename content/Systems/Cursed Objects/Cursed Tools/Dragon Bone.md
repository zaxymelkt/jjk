# Overview
Dragon-Bone is a thick single-edged blade with three engine-type holes in the back. The blade is connected to a highly mechanical hilt. The bottom section beneath the holes is covered by the extended handguard, which has several square shapes protruding from it. In contrast to the hilt, it has a much less mechanical handle where the sword is gripped. 

The handle appears to be is covered in stitched-together cloth and is decorated with a ribbon at the end of the hilt. This cursed tool has the ability to build up kinetic force as well as cursed energy. Dragon-Bone can eject both forces back out of the three engines to propel the blade at the user's will, granting it far greater cutting power than normal.

- Dragon-Bone starts every Roleplay with 0 Charges, it gains a single Charge after every two successful attacks against a Target, alternatively it gaines a charge every time it successfully attacks a target or object imbued with Cursed Energy.
	- Dragon-Bone can hold up to 3 charges at once.
- As an action, Dragon-Bone's innate ability can be activated, each stored charge of Kinetic and Cursed Energy will be consumed at once, before being released through the exhausts at the end of the hilt. For each charge consumed, the next attack the user makes receives an Agility buff equal to the amount of stored charges times 2.
    - Alternatively, the consumed charges can be used to make an additional attack, instead of buffing the users Agility.
- After any amount of charges are consumed, Dragon-Bone goes on Cooldown for 3 turns.
