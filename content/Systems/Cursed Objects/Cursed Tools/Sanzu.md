# Overview
Sanzu, the weapon once wielded by the Demonic Warrior - [[Ichikawa Arata]] is a blade-like Cursed Tool. With a long handle, capable of being wielded in a double-gripped position. The length of its blade eclipses that of most Katana, being similar in size to that of a broadsword. The key difference being its front facing blade is jagged, cut with 'teeth' like mounds that seem to be capable of hacking through opponents with persistent swings. It has five grooves along the flat back of its blade, which begin to glow as charges are gained.

>[!important] Recovery
> Sanzu starts every RP with 0 Charges. It gains a single Charge after every successful attack against a Target.
> 
> At any time, Sanzu's charges may be consumed as an action. 
> When Consumed, each charge will either give its wielder:
> -  5 Health Points
> - Remove 1 level of status condition or injury.
>
> Multiple charges may be consumed by 1 action.
> 
> After using **Recovery**, this ability goes on a 3 turn cooldown.


> [!important] Wind Cutter
> This technique takes 2 actions, and allows the user to propel a blast of sharpened air from their swing of the blade. This attack is incredibly swift, moving at the users STR +4, and dealing damage equal to their ATK STR.
> 
> After using 'Wind Cutter', it goes on a 2 turn cooldown.
