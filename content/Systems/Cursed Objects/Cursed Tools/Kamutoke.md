# Overview
Kamutoke is a small weapon that resembles a tokkosho (a single-bladed vajra), although with Kamutoke's thin, dagger-like blade being on one side only. The central grip section is bordered on either side by a pair of flat hoops that cross at a right angle, thus forming spheres. The history of this weapon traces all the way back to the Heian era, where it was created for Ryomen Sukuna as a form of wedding proposal, Sukuna denied this proposal, and killed the potential bride, though he kept this dagger as a momento.

- Can only deal [[Injuries#Shallow Laceration|Shallow Lacerations]].
