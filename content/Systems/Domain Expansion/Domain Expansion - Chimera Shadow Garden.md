title: Domain Expansion - Chimera Shadow Garden

domain: Incomplete

_While still incomplete, Chimera Shadow Garden floods the area with thick fluid shadows. This grants the user the ability to manifest multiple shikigami, as well as advanced manipulation of all available shadows. With an enclosed barrier, Chimera Shadow Garden traps the target inside the user's shadow, recolouring the entire space into a negative palette._ _It also conjures a large object that resembles two columns of a spinal bone with bow-shaped ropes tied and roots attached to it. This disappears soon after the initial casting of the domain._

While within the space granted of this Incomplete Domain, the users connection to Shadows becomes far deeper, releasing the full potential of themselves and their Shikigami, they gain the following benefits :

- While this Domain is active, the user can summon 2 of their tamed Shikigami without expending any Cursed Energy. 
	- These Shikigami must be defined at the start of the user's turn, and can only be changed at the start of a new turn.
- Alternatively, the user may summon a single Enhanced Shikigami without expanding any Cursed Energy.
- Upon being struck by an attack, the user can choose to sacrifice one of their freely summoned Shikigami, replacing themselves with Shadow and nullifying the attack.
	- Upon activating this ability, the amount of Shikigami you can summon for free at the start of your next turn is reduced by 1.
- Those within this Domain, excluding the user and their Shikigami, must imbue their feet with Cursed Energy, failure to do so results in a -4 debuff to their Agility.
