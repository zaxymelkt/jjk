# Incomplete
Kﾄ［adhﾄ》u Shrine or 'Shrine of worldly desire' manifests as a central shrine which has talismans spread across the floor, walls, and ceiling of the inclosed space. A Dense, eerie fog obscures the surroundings. The shrine itself contains the many faces of the Fujiwara Clan, most notably, that of Fujiwara Emiko. The domain's power is directly proportional to Hoshikakushi's willingness to sacrifice himself. If his resolve wavers, the domain's effectiveness diminishes.
- Within in the domain, all things are 'touching' the user's palm.
 - Limited to [[Shrine#20 Cursed Energy Output|(Lv2) Cleave]].
- Cleave's cooldown is turned to a per target cd.
- Within the domain, [[Shrine#Dismantle|Dismantle]] can be used twice or [[Shrine#Cleave|Cleave]] can be used once without an energy cost.
