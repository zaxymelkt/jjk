# Complete Domain Expansion : Kﾄ［adhﾄ》u Shrine
> The "Shrine of Worldly Desire" appears as a main sanctuary adorned with amulets scattered throughout its interior, covering the floor, walls, and ceiling. This shrine features a solitary entryway, a stairway ascending 25 meters to its peak. It is encircled by the skeletal remains of victims from Hoshikakushi's tenure as an assassin for the Fujiwara clan, displayed in a state of crucifixion and incineration. The shrine's decor includes the liquefied forms of the Fujiwara Clan members, with a pristine image of Fujiwara Emiko prominently placed at the apex. The entire domain is treated as Hoshikakushi's Palm.
> 
> The domain functions under three directives:
> - [[Shrine#Cleave|Cleave]] all Cursed Energy
> - [[Shrine#Dismantle|Dismantle]] the Environment
> - [[Shrine#[Maximum Technique] Furnace|Incinerate]] the Fallen.
> 
> During the manifestation of the domain, individuals holding either Hoshikakushi's left or right hand are positioned alongside him at the heart of the shrine. However, this arrangement prevents Hoshikakushi from denying access to anyone entering during manifestation. Notably, only Fujiwara Emiko is permitted to grasp his left hand.
> 
> Upon the domain's manifestation, the shrine's gates swing open, initiating an assault that reveals Hoshikakushi at the entrance, centrally located within the shrine, against a backdrop of darkness cascading down the shrine's steps.
> 
> At the core of the shrine, where Hoshikakushi stands and the domain originates, exists a 'safe zone.' Within this approximately 5-meter radius, neither cleave nor dismantle have effect. Beyond this area, every entity within the domain, including Hoshikakushi himself, becomes susceptible to these effects.
> 
> While [[Shrine#Cleave|Cleave]] and [[Shrine#Dismantle|Dismantle]] are active, the Shrine doors remain open. Uniquely, Hoshikakushi is not the source of these attacks; instead, the shrine itself generates them. 
> 
> To maximise the effectiveness of the '[[Shrine#[Maximum Technique] Furnace|Furnace]]' technique, the shrine doors shut, indicating the technique's initiation. The shrine then ignites, and the charred remains dispersed throughout the domain guide the technique towards its intended targets, consuming them. Should any perish, they join the ranks of the crucified.
