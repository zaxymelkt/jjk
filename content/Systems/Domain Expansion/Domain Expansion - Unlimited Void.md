_Befitting its name, Unlimited Void brings the user and their targets inside the Limitless itself, which is an endless void resembling outer space in appearance, with a large black hole, distant galaxies and numerous white patches in the background. Boundless raw information floods into the target's mind, overwhelming them to the point where they're completely immobilized._ _The complete incapacitation of the target is caused by a phenomenon where the target will be able to see and feel everything while not being able to see or feel anything at the same time. All the actions one has taken in their life is forced upon them infinitely and they can't do anything but die slowly._

- Upon Activating this Domain, all entities besides Tatsuki ( and those he is in physical contact with ) are Stunned for 1 full turn.
- After this, they will be considered 'Dazed' for every turn after the first, until the Domain ends. As well as this, they lose 1 Reaction for every turn that they are within the Domain past the first.
- After the Domain ends, the target will remain Dazed for a single turn as they adjust to the outside world. When the Domain ends, the debuff to their Reaction becomes permanent.
- Every turn the Domain is in use, the user can cast either 'Lapse Blue' or 'Reversal Red' once for free.
