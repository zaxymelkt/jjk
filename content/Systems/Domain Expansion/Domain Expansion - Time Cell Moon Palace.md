# Domain Expansion - Time Cell Moon Palace
While within the perimeter of Isao's Domain, he does not need to make contact in with his targets in order to activate his 'Freeze Frame' technique, as everyone is considered to be within arms reach of him. 

As well as this, Isao can instead choose to isolate the activation of his 'Freeze Frame' technique to a single part of the targets body. 

If the target attempts to move that part of the body without envisioning the 24 Frames of Movement, they are considered to be 'out of sync', causing the cells in that portion of the body to erupt. 
- That portion of the targets body receives 'Broken 2'. 
- When targeting the cells of a targets body, there is a 2 Turn Cooldown on any target already affected by this technique.
