# Domain Expansion - Time Cell Moon Palace
While within the perimeter of Isao's Domain, he does not need to make contact in with his targets in order to activate his 'Freeze Frame' technique, as everyone is considered to be within arms reach of him. 

As well as this, Isao can instead choose to isolate the activation of his 'Freeze Frame' technique to a single part of the targets body. 

If the target attempts to move that part of the body without envisioning the 24 Frames of Movement, they are considered to be 'out of sync', causing the cells in that portion of the body to erupt. 
- That portion of the targets body receives 'Broken 2'. 
- When targeting the cells of a targets body, there is a 2 Turn Cooldown on any target already affected by this technique.

# Domain Expansion - Time Cell Moon Palace
Expanding this domain casts a black empty area save for a few floating particles and the main stage of the environment. The primary stage of the Time Cell Moon Palace is comprised of a straight path of flesh that leads to a large eye behind the caster. The auto-hit function of the domain injects films of animation frames into the neck of its targets. Anyone who moves within the domain must abide by the 24FPS rule of Projection Sorcery or they will receive numerous bloody injuries with every movement. 

- Within in the domain, all things are 'touching' the user's palm. 
- Isao can instead choose to isolate the activation of his '[[Projection Sorcery#Freeze Frame:|Freeze Frame]]' technique to a single part of the targets body. 
	- If the target attempts to move that part of the body they are considered to be 'out of sync', causing the cells in that portion of the body to erupt. 
		- That portion of the targets body receives [[Status Conditions#Broken|Broken]] 3 & [[Status Conditions#Bleed|Bleed]] 1
- There is a One Turn Cooldown on targeting an individual with this technique. 
	- Every turn within the Domain, Isao can and MUST cast three Cursed Techniques towards all targets within the barrier of his Domain. 
- These techniques can be either his [[Projection Sorcery#Cellular Freeze|Cellular Freeze]], [[Projection Sorcery#Freeze Frame:|Freeze Frame]], or [[Projection Sorcery#Air Freeze:|Air Freeze]]. However, the cooldowns of these techniques still apply.
