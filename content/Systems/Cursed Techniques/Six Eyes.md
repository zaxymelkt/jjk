*The Six Eyes are an idiosyncrasy rarely inherited within the Gojo clan. They are not a cursed technique that needs to be activated, but an innate gift that grants the bearer the ability to master the Limitless. Several hundred years can pass before a bearer of the Six Eyes appears, and no two bearers can exist at the same time.*

Those who are blessed with the inherited blessing of the Six Eyes are said to bear with them the power to change the course of history, infamously tied not only to Master Tengan, but the Star Plasma vessel themselves, fate and destiny bend to the whims of those who carry these blessed eyes. The Six Eyes carry with them a plethora of unique boons and abilities, making whoever carries them adeptly capable in combat when paired with the Limitless Technique.
