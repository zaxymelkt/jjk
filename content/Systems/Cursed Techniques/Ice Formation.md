This cursed technique allows the user to lower the temperature to extreme levels of cold. These freezing temperatures allow the user to produce ice and frost at will. The user can generate multiple sheets of solid ice by simply touching a surface. They can also manifest other forms of ice such as a cloud of frozen mist. The ice can also be cryokinetically controlled by the user, allowing them to levitate it through the air using only their mind.

The beholder of this innate technique is immune to the effects of frostbite. 

The user requires concentration to maintain their cursed technique, losing it will result in the Ice being melted immediately.

Chilling the area does not take an attack action, however, besides cursed energy reinforcement, using anything outside of the innate technique will end concentration. 

- At 25 Reaction you are capable of physically fighting while chilling an area.
	- However, you are unable to create ice formations while moving.
- At 35 Reaction you are capable of moving while creating ice formations.
	- You are not capable of full fledged combat unless creating small items.
	- You cannot move while creating Extra Large Items.
- At 45 Reaction you are capable of maintaining combat while forming medium items.
	- You can now maintain movement while creating Extra Large Items.

Small Items:
- Less than 2 Slots.

- Counts as 1/4 of an ‘attack’ to form/use.

Medium Items:
- Between 3-5 Slots.
- Between 0.75m to 2.5m in size.
- Counts as 1/2 of an ‘attack’ to form/use.

Large Items:

Once an area is chilled, that specific location will only require 1 turn to rechill if concentration is lost.

Chilled area’s frostbitten is done to one location, not full body.

Ice Creations do not get Weapon size buffs from the cursed tools system.

Every 10 C.E Control you may select 1 person to not suffer the ill effects of ‘chilled’.
