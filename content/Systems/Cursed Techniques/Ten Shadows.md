# 10 Cursed Energy Output :
Upon reaching adolescence, those within the Zen’in clan will show signs of manifesting their Cursed Technique, none as obvious as those who have been blessed with the Ten Shadows technique. Black pools of inky darkness pooling by their feet, a twin set of howls rupture the stillness of the air, as from that pool of shadows rise a complementary set of dogs, one as white as snow, the other as dark as shadow. These creatures are known as ‘Divine Dogs’ and are said to be the oldest companions to the Zen’in clan, supporting the use of the Ten Shadows technique to defeat and tame the remaining Shikigami.

- You gain access to the first of the Ten Shadow Shikigami, the Divine Dogs. ( See Below ).
- When summoning your Shikigami, they appear within 2 Meters of you at a speed equal to your C.E Control +5, being dispelled at your C.E Control.
- If the Health of your Shikigami ever reaches 0, they will ‘die’, this may cause an evolution in your 10 Shadows Technique if certain conditions are met.
- While unsummoned, Shikigami regain 5 Health per turn, starting after the first turn they’ve been unsummoned.
- You have a general awareness as to where your Shikigami are in relation to you, and do not need a line of sight to dispel them.
- You are now able to challenge any of the other Ten Shadows Shikigami, gaining the ability to summon them at your command if you defeat them in single combat (Shikigami not included).

# 20 Cursed Energy Output :
Considerable growth has been made, moving from a novice to someone capable of grappling with the intricacies of the Ten Shadows technique, deepening your connections to the Shadows which hold your Shikigami. Gaining the ability to store and retrieve items from these pools of black depthlessness, allowing you to have easy access to all sorts of Cursed Tools, esoteric items and Cursed Objects you may be holding at any given time. Additionally, you can now ‘combine’ two of your contracted Shikigami, giving birth to a synthesis between them both, granting you a new, versatile power.

- You gain access to combine two distinct Shikigami with one another, their abilities fusing together with one another to create a new, unique form of Shikigami.
- This Shikigami can only be summoned so long as its two ‘parent’ Shikigami are not summoned.
- However, if their ‘parent’ shikigami were to die, you can still summon this fusion.
- You gain access to the supplemental ‘Shadow Storage’ technique, capable of storing a number of weapons, items and apparel in a segmented ‘pocket dimension’ stored within your shadow. This Shadow can store up to 15 Slots worth of items at any given time.
- Placing an item into the Shadow has no cost, however it takes 1 full turn to do so, unless the item is considered ‘Large’, which will take two turns.
- Retrieving items costs 5 C.E Reserves per small item, 9 C.E Reserves per medium item and 15 C.E 
- Reserves per large item, these items appear at a speed equal to your C.E Control +5.
- If you die, all items held within the Shadows are immediately ejected.

# 30 Cursed Energy Output :
Your connection to the shadows of the world continues, now capable of storing an additional 10 Slots worth of items within its inky depths. Growing adept with your manipulation of the shadows, now capable of imparting yourself within them, sliding into their confines and moving through their connected, interwoven darkness. Allowing you to more easily travel great distances without danger, and grant deeper insight into those you choose to spy and stalk while swaddled in the darkness.

- The storage of your Shadow Storage increases to hold 20 Slots.
- You can now enhance your Shikigami, allowing them to gain access to a new trait, ability or attribute that they were not previously able to use. This cost is dependent on the Shikigami, but can range from an increase in stats, unique attribute or a transformation of the Shikigami or user.
- Deepening your connection to the Shadows where your Shikigami dwell, you’re now capable of entering these pools of darkness, hiding within the Shadows themselves. Upon making contact, you can choose to sink into the shadows surrounding you, gliding through them as though it were water, so long as shadows are connected, you can move between them. Allowing you an unparalleled advantage in espionage and sneakery.
- While in the shadows, you move at a speed equal to your C.E Control +5, costing you 11 Cursed Energy Reserves per turn to do so.
- If the surface you inhabit is destroyed, you are immediately ejected from the shadow, taking damage as though you had been hit by the attack.

# 40 Cursed Energy Output :
Forging a stronger bond with your Shikigami, you learn how to further enhance their capabilities. Capable of causing rapid and spontaneous growth, distorting the shape of your Shikigami to that of a monstrous size, raising both their strength and constitution dramatically.

- The storage of your Shadow Storage increases to hold 30 Slots.
- You gain access to combine three distinct Shikigami with one another, their abilities fusing together with one another to create a new, unique form of Shikigami.
- This Shikigami can only be summoned so long as its three ‘parent’ Shikigami are not summoned.
- However, if their ‘parent’ shikigami were to die, you can still summon this fusion.
- Forging a deeper connection to your Shikigami, you can now flood an additional influx of Cursed Energy into them, bolstering their size, power and health. The Shikigami grows to be 10 Meters high, their appendages and extensions growing to be proportional, becoming a monstrous creature, distorting their expressions and previous beauty.
- While their size is increased, the Shikigami gain the following buffs:
	`+30 Health, +6 Strength, +6 C.E Output, -7 C.E Control,  -7 Speed.`
	- In order to increase the size of a Shikigami, it costs 35 Cursed Energy Reserves for every 2 Turns.

# 50 Cursed Energy Output :
In legends old, they say that it was a member of the Zen’in Clan who had mastered and tamed the Ten Shadows who was capable of not only rivaling, but besting those who were blessed by both heaven and earth, the Six Eyes bearer of the Gojo Clan. You have reached that height, with a unique arsenal of Shikigami and Chimera, a depthless shadow to hold and hide your Cursed Tools, and the ability to truly embody the aspects of all your Shikigami, your power, adaptability and utility are unmatched.

- The storage of your Shadow Storage increases to hold 40 Slots.
- You gain access to combine four distinct Shikigami with one another, their abilities fusing together with one another to create a new, unique form of Shikigami.
- This Shikigami can only be summoned so long as its four ‘parent’ Shikigami are not summoned.
- However, if their ‘parent’ shikigami were to die, you can still summon this fusion.
- At this level, your bond with your Shikigami has reached its zenith, you are now capable of bearing the traits of your Shikigami without summoning them ( Divine Dogs claws, Mahoraga’s Wheel, Nue’s Electricity ), allowing you to activate a select amount of their abilities in their stead.
	- In order to bear these traits, it costs 25 Cursed Energy Reserves and 12 Reserves per turn.
	- While bearing these traits, you cannot summon the Shikigami it belongs to.
