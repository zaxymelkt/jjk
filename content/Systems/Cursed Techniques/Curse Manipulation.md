As the name suggests, Cursed Spirit Manipulation is a technique where one can completely control cursed spirits they were able to conquer in battle. Rather than exercise a cursed spirit, the user can absorb them into a small black sphere. A cursed manipulator can also absorb curses from anyone also capable of controlling them by killing the master. Attempting to absorb the curse without doing so first will physically repel them. Orally consuming this orb of the curse's remains gives the user complete dominance over the vagabond curse, allowing them to summon them at any time in the future. 

This technique is not without its risks, as you must put your body and soul on the line to successfully capture and tame these wild monstrosities. Their loyalty to you is fickle, extending only so long as you hold the power to keep them bound. Upon entering a near death state, as well as dying, the Cursed Spirits within you will begin to rampage, breaking free from your control and releasing themselves from your body all at once.
