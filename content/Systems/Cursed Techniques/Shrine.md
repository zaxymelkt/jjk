This technique is a relic of a far more brutal, evil age of Sorcery, and those who hold it should they choose to expose it unto the world. Let you be cursed to suffer a torturous death for your vanity in reawakening this sleeping butchery. This technique, whispered in the pages of history to be ‘Shrine’, is thought to have belonged solely to Ryomen Sukuna, The King of Curses. How it found its way to the present, none can be certain, all that is known is that The Second coming of Calamity has found its way to this age.

Cleave and Dismantle take the form of shredding cuts that are formed through the user's careful application and moulding of their malicious Cursed Energy, Cleave boasting the higher [[Statistics#C.E Output [C.E.O]|Cursed Energy Output]] of the two, capable of inflicting devastating injuries onto their targets. Dismantle, despite being far less powerful, holds within it a ranged application, and is far more swift than its destructive counterpart.
# Cleave

## 10 Cursed Energy Output :
Considered to be unparalleled within the realm of short ranged techniques, Cleave is said to cut and dismember with all the viciousness of a mad-butcher's cleaver, paired with the precision of a calm surgeon's scalpel. This technique requires physical contact to be made between the user and its target, capable of splitting wood and cracking concrete with the graze of their palm. At this level, the wound Cleave is capable of inflicting is rather shallow, but can be used in rapid succession, allowing the user to perform a death by a thousand cuts.

- Increases the users C.E Output by +2.
- Causes a Shallow Laceration on impact.
- 13 Cursed Energy Reserves.
## 20 Cursed Energy Output :
Cleave’s output has shown incredible growth, providing an increase to the user's own Cursed Output as well as the size and depth of the cut created. Still requiring physical contact to be made and maintained, Cleave can now shatter reinforced concrete, and has started to marr and dent steel beams. Capable of leveling scaffolding and most walls found within an apartment or office complex, environmental destruction and physical dismemberment is often left in the wake of those who utilize this wicked curse.

- Increases the users C.E Output by +4.
- Causes a Medium Laceration on impact, or 2 Shallow Lacerations.
- 1 Turn Cooldown.
- 15 Cursed Energy Reserves.
## 30 Cursed Energy Output :
The depth of your Cleave has reached a lethal level, capable of splitting the head from someone's neck should you catch them at the right opportunity, the hemorrhaging technique now leaves a ‘patchwork’ style cut on impact with your target, capable of spreading out across the entirety of their limb or torso, if you choose to decrease the depth and lethality of the cut. Instead overlapping two separate networks of cuts. The power of your Cleave can now break through reinforced metal, so long as it is not being infused with Cursed Energy.

- Increases the users C.E Output by +6.
- Causes a Deep Laceration on impact, or 2 Medium lacerations.
- 1 Turn Cooldown.
- 17 Cursed Energy Reserves.
## 40 Cursed Energy Output :
Lo, a fledgling calamity is born. The intricacies of your cuts become lost in a sea of red that spill forth, pressurized geysers of blood erupting in the wake of your techniques wrath, painting the wool of the sheep around you red with crimson. You can now, with a carefully placed Cleave, cause small scaled buildings to collapse under the pressure exerted by this technique, leaving behind you an aftershock of destruction fitting of a Calamity of your stature.
- Increases the users C.E Output by +8.
- Causes 2 Deep Lacerations on impact, or 4 Medium lacerations.
- 2 Turn Cooldown.
- 21 Cursed Energy Reserves.
## 50 Cursed Energy Output :
Brutality, gore, a disregard for life not seen since the Heian Era. You carry in the palm of your hand the peak of brutality and malice, capable of ripping those before you asunder at a graze. You no longer need to worry about the placement of this technique when applied against the surface of a structure, for most will buckle and break beneath the weight and density of your cruelty. The cost of this technique is great, the user often feeling a ‘kickback’, but that is a small price to pay for the butchery they will unleash.

- Increases the users C.E Output by +12.
- Causes 1 Partial Amputation on impact, or 4 Deep Lacerations.
- 3 Turn Cooldown.
- 24 Cursed Energy Reserves.
## Cleave : SpiderWeb

# Dismantle

## 10 Cursed Energy Output :
Weaker than its paired technique, Dismantle excels as a ranged alternative to the close quarters nature of Cleave. Providing little depth to the cuts it produces, the speed at which these cuts can appear on their target is truly supernatural. Those who are caught unaware may not notice the initial gash caused by Dismantle, shrugging it off, allowing the user to quickly overwhelm their opponents with fast acting cuts, a fast and efficient butchery.

- Increases the users C.E Control by +2.
- Length of the cut is 4 inches.
- Dismantle has an effective range of 8 Meters at this level.
- 7 Cursed Energy Reserves.
## 20 Cursed Energy Output :
A substantial increase in range, the speed of Dismantle has shown less growth than the power of its physical counterpart. However, the once un-noticed cuts have become much more noticeable, now only a stage behind its more destructive pair, Dismantle has shown to also be capable of empowerment, through the recitation of a terrible chanting, increasing its Cursed Output dramatically, shortening the gap between it and Cleave with little downside.

- Increases the users C.E Control by +3.
- Causes a Shallow Laceration on impact.
- You learn the Chant ‘Dragon Scales’, increasing the C.E Output of this technique by +2. This chant increases the cost of the technique by 6 Cursed Energy Reserves.
- Length of the cut is 12 inches.

- 9 Cursed Energy Reserves.

## 30 Cursed Energy Output :
Boasting overwhelming speed, this level of Dismantle is capable of creating a series of cuts that appear on the surface of your opponent within a blink of an eye. Though the power of Dismantle has not shown any improvements, the number of cuts created has shown a considerable leap, further capable of increasing its destructive force with an elongated, wicked incantation performed before the release of this technique.

- Increases the users C.E Control by +5.
- Causes 2 Shallow Lacerations on impact.

- Dismantle has an effective range of 12 Meters at this level.
- 12 Cursed Energy Reserves.
## 40 Cursed Energy Output :
Approaching the zenith of this technique, with a flick of your finger you can eviscerate those who stand before you, seldomly rivaled in the potency of its speed, cuts appearing and overlapping one another in sporadic fashion, impossible to predict where they will erupt, as though the skin that coats your victim had always planned to rip itself asunder. The final phrase of your wicked incantation now becomes known, allowing you to cast out such destruction, one might think you’ve learned to ‘throw’ the Cleave which resides upon your evil palms.

- Increases the users C.E Control by +7.
- Causes a Medium Laceration on impact.
- Dismantle has an effective range of 14 Meters at this level.
- Length of the cut is 20 inches.

## 50 Cursed Energy Output :
Careful where you step, a Calamity lies near. Nestled within your soul, a raging tempest of gore. Capable of being flung through the air, and awoken with a chant. The range of your Dismantle has reached its maximum, a large gash forming upon the surface where your technique strikes. With this power resting in your palms, one would not be mistaken to label you a curse, for you resemble them far more than you do humans, with such calamitous power.

- Increases the users C.E Control by +7.
- Causes a Medium Laceration on impact.
- You learn the Chant ‘Dragon Scales, Repulsion, Paired Falling Stars’, increasing the C.E Output of this technique by +6. This chant increases the cost of the technique by 11 Cursed Energy Reserves.
