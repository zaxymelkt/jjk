Within the world of Jujutsu Sorcery, Innate Techniques define the fate of those who exist within it. A sorcerer's worth can often be measured by the family that they belong to, predetermined to reach a certain height, or to crawl along the ground like worms. Often those who are born with a low reserve of Cursed Energy are doomed to face a life of injustice and depravity, left to the wayside of society. You alone have escaped this fate, released from the threads that bind Jujutsu Society, you alone are free.

  

Within the scope of this Heavenly Restriction, you will climb the ranks to become a true martial god, the likes of which have not been since the Heian Era. You will shake up this world, as a true demonic fighter.

# Extra Sensory Perception [Sixth Sense]
Sixth Sense determines the potency of the additional sense of ‘Atmospheric Pressure’ engraved into one’s body. The Sixth Sense can be seen as a slow ‘awakening’ process, which is done over a lifetime of training one’s body. At the beginning, they require specialised tools to see Cursed Spirits, but as their Sixth Sense develops, everything becomes visible.

*Atmospheric Sense will ‘warn’ the individual of anything within the radius.
