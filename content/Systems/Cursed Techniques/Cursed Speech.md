Members born into the Inumaki family are granted the inherited technique of Cursed Speech, their words turning into their weapons, capable of delivering unique and devastating effects unto those they speak with. Many members of this ancient clan choose to live their life in a conscious form of selective mutism, finding unique work arounds to generic forms of conversation as a way to protect those around them from the effects of their terrible curse.

The use of this curse itself is not based around intent, but focus. Uttering any of these phrases, or phrases similar to them will invoke the activation of the curse on those nearest to them. Members of the Inumaki clan must 'focus' their words to cause them to travel towards a specific target. The sound waves created in this moment are imbued with Cursed Energy and upon reaching their target evoke the powers of the curse.

Depending on the volume at which the user speaks, the range of this effective technique as well as its detrimental effects are determined, forcing users to get close to their opponents if they wish to preserve their ability to speak. When issuing a command, the user has 15 'uses' before their throat closes up from the pain. Every 2 turns spent not issuing a command results in 3 uses returning to the user, as their muscles relax.
