There is a truth in Jujutsu Society, that love can often spawn the most twisted of Curses. These words have never rang more true in relation to this innate technique, a perversion of your affection made manifest. The unplanned departure of your loved one left a scar upon your soul, and you a scar upon theirs. The infusion of Cursed Energy within the fleeting vestiges of their being, binding you both together, in sickness and in health, to death do you part.  
  
The manifestation of this Curse has caused a distortion your former lovers form, creating a hulking mass of a curse, ivory like skin with dark streaks surrounding their torso, a smooth upper face with a toothy maw, the top of their head distorted in thick lines, like the dents of a brain, all coalescing in a ghostlike tail at the bottom of their body.

# 10 Cursed Energy Control : 
The curse that binds the soul of your loved one has yet to be untangled, the perversion and distortion of their personality is at its peak. At this level, you are unable to control the Cursed Entity bound to your soul, their previous personality becoming distorted, far more childlike and infantile, responding to bursts of emotions with little to no self control. She will attack blindly, seeing most everyone as an enemy and threat to you. Despite being incredibly protective, she may inadvertently cause you harm.

- Full Manifestation costs 35 Cursed Energy, with an additional 25 Cursed Energy every turn she remains manifested.
- Miyo manifests at a speed equal to your C.E Control.
- While Miyo is manifested, you ignore the condition of not casting any Cursed Techniques to recharge your reserves passively.
- Miyo may forcibly emerge at any time, if she feels as though you are in enough danger to warrant her protection, this will be up to a [HOSTS] discretion.

Now capable of calling upon a partial manifestation of the Queen of Curses. Taking the form of one of her destructive limbs, in this case, her arm. The partial manifestation of this curse is far more controllable, capable of fine and controlled movement, able to wield tools in the right circumstance, but no higher than basic motions and guards. Her strength is incredibly powerful, capable of shattering buildings and breaking bones at a slightest touch.

- Partially manifesting Miyo costs 17 Cursed Energy, with an additional 13 Cursed Energy per turn she manifests.
- Miyo can no longer force herself to manifest. However, if you are placed in a Near Death state, or she believes you may die, a forced manifestation may occur with strenuous effort.
- Additionally, you can now force Miyo to bend to your commands, by expanding a large amount of Cursed Energy, you can cause a Complete Manifestation to occur, capable of exuding control over Miyo for a single turn, directing her rage and anger in a direction of your choosing, or offering her a simple command such as ‘Protect me’, ‘Kill them’, ‘Help us’.
- In order to safely Manifest Miyo for one turn, you must spend half of your maximum Cursed Energy reserves, unreduced, costing 25 Cursed Energy every turn she remains manifested.
