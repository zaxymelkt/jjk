This technique divides one second into twenty-four frames of animation using the user's field of view as the projection angle of view. The user can trace a predetermined set of movements into those twenty-four frames and execute them in that single second. Moving using this technique makes the user appear to move unnaturally fast, too quick for even special grade cursed spirits to follow.

While Projection Sorcery is active, anything touched by the user's palm must also abide by the "24 FPS" rule while moving. Failure to do so results in the subject getting immobilized and frozen in an animation frame for one second. Although it's just a second, anything caught in that frame is completely vulnerable to attack. Hitting the frame will break the target out of it, usually heavily injuring them.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The speed at which a user of projection sorcery moves while engaging their 12 and 24 frame techniques is not the speed at which they attack, it is purely the speed they MOVE at before stopping. You must “stop” to make an attack.

# 10 Cursed Energy Control :
## **12 Frames:**
Passed between the Zen’in family, and believed to be one of their greatest and most prized techniques. Your current level of Projection Sorcery is merely at its infancy, incapable of reaching the greatest heights that the more senior members of your family can utilize freely. At this stage, you cannot comprehend the incredible movements and precision required to move 24 times within a single moment. Instead, you have grasped the concept in a much shorter timeframe, now capable of moving in ‘12 frame’ animation, your movements are choppy, but still quite quick.

- While moving through the predetermined set of twelve frames, the user of this technique moves at a speed equal to their C.E Control+5.
- Upon emerging, the first attack you make within the same turn moves at a speed equal to your Agility+1.
- Due to the relationship between weight and velocity, when you come to a stop and strike a target you deal an additional 2 points of Damage.
- This increases the distance you can travel in a turn by 4 MD.
- This technique can be used in reaction to an attack.
- 2 Turn CD.
- 12 Cursed Energy.

# 20 Cursed Energy Control : 
## **24 Frames:**
You have developed the mind of an artist, now capable of better interpreting and realizing the complex motions and movements required in order to move at a full 24 frames. Far away from mastering this technique, your overall speed increases dramatically, building up an additional weight of force when you make contact with another individual. Additionally, your burst of speed has not increased the total distance you are capable of moving within a turn, as well as the speed at which your attacks are launched in the aftermath.

- While moving through the predetermined set of twenty four frames, the user of this technique moves at a speed equal to their C.E Control+10.
- Upon emerging, the first attack you make within the same turn moves at a speed equal to your Agility+3, the second moves at your Agility+1.
- Due to the relationship between weight and velocity, when you come to a stop and strike a target you deal an additional 3 points of Damage.
- This increases the distance you can travel in a turn by 7 MD.
- This technique can be used in reaction to an attack.
- 1 Turn CD.
- 14 Cursed Energy.

## Freeze Frame:
Upon making contact with an individual, and flowing your Cursed Energy through them, activating your Projection Sorcery upon the target. In theory, this should allow for them to move as fast and with as much velocity behind them as you. However, they are not yet accustomed to the precise methodology of these movements, and as such if they cannot comprehend the speed at which you are moving they will instead freeze up into a single frame. Stuck in a static pose, lingering in the air for a moment before returning to normal.

- If the target of this ability would be incapable of reacting to the maximum velocity of your movement ( At this level, C.E Control +10 ), they are instantly frozen into a single frame of animation.
- While in this suspended state, they are considered “stunned”. 
- They immediately leave this state of suspended animation upon being struck, or if 1 turn passes.
- If struck with a Cursed Technique or weapon, the properties attached to those attacks will not transfer, ( Bleed, burn, broken ) but the overall force will.
- 15 Cursed Energy if used on its own.
- 11 Cursed Energy if used after emerging from 24 Frames.

# 30 Cursed Energy Control : 
## 24 Frames:
TBA.
- While moving through the predetermined set of twenty four frames, the user of this technique moves at a speed equal to their C.E Controlx2.
- Upon emerging, the first attack you make within the same turn moves at a speed equal to your Agility+4, the second moves at your Agility+2.
- Due to the relationship between weight and velocity, when you come to a stop and strike a target you deal an additional 5 points of Damage.
- This technique can be used in reaction to an attack.
- 1 Turn CD.
- 18 Cursed Energy.

## Air Freeze:
TBA.
- Upon holding your hand to the air, you ‘freeze’ the particular moment into a suspended state. Upon doing so, you can quickly close your hand into a fist, colliding against the thin surface, causing a rapid combustion of cursed Energy to erupt down a line.
- The range and size of this blast is roughly 5 Meters long and 1 Meter wide, those caught within the Blast are damaged at your C.E Output+5.
- The combustion of the blast happens at your C.E Control.
- 24 Cursed Energy.
