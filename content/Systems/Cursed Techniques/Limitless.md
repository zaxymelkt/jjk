The Limitless technique allows the user to bring the concept of "Infinity" into reality, allowing them to manipulate and distort space at will. Famed for its impenetrable defense, and incredible destructive prowess. The sub-series of limitless techniques hold within them an unimaginable power, turning a single individual into a being capable of carving through mass hordes of enemies, both Curses and Sorcerers alike. Armed with both a shield and spear, those blessed to inherit the Limitless are akin to gods among men, with their affinity in manipulating space, giving them the power to decimate the battlefield, maneuver through the sky and vanish from sight and space.

But what about those who are gods above gods? In every major age of sorcery, there are those who transcend the human bound of strength, achieving a higher level of enlightenment than all others. The infamous Six Eyes gives its bearer a near anatomical insight into Cursed Energy, placing them atop a pedestal even further above those who share their techniques, rendering them a pale imitation of true, unburdened power.

When using Six Eyes, all the costs of Limitless are halved, rounding down.
