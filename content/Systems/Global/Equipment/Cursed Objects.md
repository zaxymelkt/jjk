Cursed Objects are items with a dark history that contain cursed energy. They generally consist of the remnants of ancient sorcerers that can be incarnated into a new body if the cursed object is consumed by a compatible vessel.

# Overview
With the exception of [[Cursed Tools]] and cursed corpses, items that contain cursed energy are referred to as cursed objects. Cursed objects are ranked in the same way as cursed tools, based on the strength of the cursed energy they contain. Particularly dangerous cursed objects, such as [[Ryomen Sukuna's Finger]], are ranked special grade. Following the logic of controlling poison with poison, sealed special grade cursed objects can be used as amulets to ward off cursed spirits.

Special grade cursed objects cannot be destroyed and their continued existence is guaranteed under the binding vow used to create them. This binding vow dictates that individuals who become cursed objects cease to live and cannot harm others.

Cursed objects are mostly used to incarnate sorcerers or to ward away curses, but some possess supernatural abilities even while existing as inanimate items. [[Prison Realm]], a special grade cursed object and the remains of the Buddhist monk Genshin, can produce a barrier powerful enough to seal anything.

## Incarnation
Incarnation is a state in which an ancient cursed object acquires a physical body using a human being as a "vessel". If a human ingests a cursed object, the owner of the cursed energy contained within that cursed object can take hold of their mind and body and can even change their appearance. It is best described as the fusion between a cursed object and human flesh.

In most cases, the host's body is completely taken over and their consciousness is completely suppressed.Incarnated individuals receive memories, knowledge, and common sense from their vessel's brains. They also retain their innate technique and all of their physical skills from their original body as well.

The [[Cursed Womb - Death Paintings]] were cursed objects created under special circumstances and sealed with a binding vow for 150 years. Death Paintings can be incarnated with any vessel and result in a cursed spirit-human hybrid as opposed to a sorcerer.
