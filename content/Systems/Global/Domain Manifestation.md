Considered to be the true pinnacle of jujutsu sorcery, Domain Expansions are precise and powerful barrier arts that grant the user total combat superiority. Within the confines of a sorcerer's domain, their innate technique is granted incredible, overwhelming power. Capable of cutting down their opponents within mere seconds if caught off guard. The only known defense to these destructive arts, is to either launch a domain of your own, or to delve into the teachings of Simple Domain, allowing you to momentarily defend against the onslaught of your opponents attacks while you attempt to shatter their domain.

## Simple Domain
[ 10 Skill Points ]

Created as a counter for domain expansions, Simple Domain neutralizes a domain's guaranteed-hit function by affecting its barrier and not the imbued cursed technique. However, against a proper domain expansion, Simple Domain can only hope to buy its user time. Powerful domains can destroy simple domains within seconds. More than this, Simple Domain is capable of diminishing the damage received by offensive techniques the target is wounded by.

- 16 Cursed Energy.
- 10 Cursed Energy per turn.
- 2 Turn Cooldown after it breaks.
- While active, the Simple Domain has 20 Health, and an Endurance equal to your C.E Output. When targeted by a ‘Sure-hit’ attack, the Simple Domains health pool is reduced instead of yours. Additionally, when hit with Cursed Techniques that are not launched from within a Domain, it reduces all damage taken by 3, which is subtracted from the Simple Domains Health Pool.

## New Shadow Style

In order to gain access to any of the techniques within the school of ‘New Shadow Style’, you must first learn the original ‘Simple Domain feature’. If you are starting with no innate technique, you start with Batto Sword Drawing.

### Batto Sword Drawing:
[ 3 Skill Points ]

Developed as a countermeasure when dealing with an incredibly agile and swift opponent, the user momentarily breaks through their bodies natural limits and swings with enough force to catch even the swiftest opponents off guard. In order to be used, the user must first cover the blade with cursed energy to greatly improve the drawing speed of the blade. Batto Sword Drawing is considered to be the fastest technique within the New Shadow Style.

- This technique costs an additional 7 Cursed Energy on top of the cost to infuse your weapon with Cursed Energy.
- This technique cannot be used on a Large Weapon.
- 2 Turn Cooldown.
- Upon stepping within 2.21 Meters radius of the user, they swing their sword with an incredible flourish, gaining +8 Agility with doing so.
  - However, those who enter the space of this technique can dictate where this technique cuts them, such as in the arm, leg, or torso.
  - The user must immediately attack the first entity to enter the space within their domain.
- If the user moves at all from the initial position they take to utilize this technique, the technique automatically ends.

### Evening Moon Sword Drawing:
[ 5 Skill Points ]

This technique extrapolates the core concept of the New Shadow Style Kenjutsu, incorporating an additional flow of Cursed Energy along your blade, allowing you to deliver slower, but more precise slices with your katana. Upon the release and draw of your sword, your aim becomes true, and it is incapable for others to dictate where your attacks upon them will land, granting you true martial superiority.

- This technique costs an additional 10 Cursed Energy on top of the cost to infuse your weapon with Cursed Energy.
- This technique cannot be used on a Large Weapon.
- This technique has a 3 Turn Cooldown.
- Removes your opponent's favourable evasion.
- You may not make any additional attacks the turn it is used.
- When drawing your sword, you gain +3 Agility to your first swing, and +1 Agility to your second.

## Clan Restricted Techniques

Although many forms of Simple Domain are known to the public, two unique branches of the art have been kept as coveted secrets within the confines of the Gojo, Zen’in and Kamo clans. In order to learn these branching points of Simple Domain, you must first learn the basics of Simple Domain, and then spend additional Skill Points to learn these variations. Individuals not from the above clans must be shown and taught how to achieve this by a member of the stated clans who has access to these techniques themselves.

### Falling Blossom Emotion:
[ 5 Skill Points ]

Unlike Simple Domain, in which the user manifests their own domain to nullify a domain expansion's auto-hit attack, Falling Blossom Emotion shrouds the user in cursed energy that counter-attacks the moment a domain's guaranteed hit makes contact. The cursed energy defends the user automatically, countering any attack with equal force to nullify it. This technique is considered to be a more offensive branching of traditional Simple Domains, allowing the user to bring the fight to their enemy even when within their Domain Expansion.

- 18 Cursed Energy.
- 11 Cursed Energy per turn.
- 1 Turn Cooldown after it breaks.
- While this counter domain is activated, the user can still perform their innate technique
- While active, the Simple Domain has 15 Health, and an Endurance equal to your C.E Output. When targeted by a ‘Sure-hit’ attack, the Simple Domains health pool is reduced instead of yours. Additionally, when hit with Cursed Techniques that are not launched from within a Domain, it reduces all damage taken by 3, which is subtracted from the Simple Domains Health Pool.

### Hollow Wicker Basket:
[ 5 Skill Points ]

The technique is invoked by a hand sign where the user folds fingers between one another while extending their arms forward. As implied by its name, Hollow Wicker Basket takes the form of a spherical, woven basket-like shield around the user.

It neutralises a domain's barrier imbued with a cursed technique to nullify its guaranteed hit. However, it cannot neutralize cursed techniques themselves, making it ineffective against incomplete or non-lethal domains.

- 20 Cursed Energy.
- 12 Cursed Energy per turn.
- Must maintain the hand sign used to deploy the technique, otherwise it automatically breaks
- 4 Turn Cooldown after it breaks.
- While active, the domain created by Hollow Wicker Basket has 30 Health, and an Endurance equal to your C.E Output. When targeted by a ‘Sure-hit’ attack, the Simple Domains health pool is reduced instead of yours. Additionally, when hit with Cursed Techniques that are not launched from within a Domain, it reduces all damage taken by 5, which is subtracted from the Simple Domains Health Pool.

## Domain Expansion

#### Environment:

Within the user's Domain Expansion, there is often a unique environmental effect that replaces whatever would have made up the interior of the domain. Ranging from unique stages and platforms, to creating changes in the weather, temperature and pressure within the domain. See below for an example as to what your Domains Environment can be:

> [!Example]
> Within Kurona’s Domain, ‘Dominion of the Iron Sea’. The floor is replaced with an ocean of thigh-high blood that produces an incredible amount of steam as it boils. There are small connections of islands within the Domain, and behind Kurona herself there is a mechanical heart with iron ribs that bloats and pumps, causing the current of this ocean to sway.
>
> Those within this Domain receive Poisoned 2, this is immediately removed 2 turns after leaving the domain.

### Incomplete Domain:
[ 15 Skill Points ]

Domains are determined to be ‘incomplete’ so long as they cannot form their internal and external barriers. In this state, you must utilize the natural structure of your surroundings to fully encompass the formation of your domain. Using features such as a cave, gymnasium, or another alternatively cramped and enclosed structure. Incomplete Domains cannot benefit from sure-hit attacks, however can be used to contest the formation of another domain in a ‘[[Domain Manifestation#Domain Clash|Domain Clash]]’ .

When launching an Incomplete Domain, the Domain is formed without internal and external barriers, allowing individuals to move in and out of the reach of your Domain. While your Domain may not create the circumstances for ‘sure-hit attacks’, they still gain the ‘Environment’ property as stated above.

Additionally, the first Curse Technique you cast within the Domain has their C.E Output increase by +3.

After your Incomplete Domain is broken or dropped, you gain [[Status Conditions#Restricted|Restricted]] 1.

#### Duration & Cost:

The amount of turns a sorcerer can maintain their domain before it forcefully ends depends on the sorcerer's [[Statistics#Cursed Energy Efficiency|C.E Efficiency]] stat.

Costing 50 [[Statistics#Cursed Energy Max|cursed energy]] to initiate, the domain can be sustained for a base of 3 emotes; ending at the start of the player's 4th turn.

- At 30 C.E Efficiency the domain can be maintained for 4 full turns.
- At 40 C.E Efficiency the domain can be maintained for 4 full turns. Lasting for 1 action of the 5th turn.
- At 50 C.E Efficiency the domain can be maintained for 5 full turns.

### Complete Domain Expansion:
[ 10 Skill Points ]

Domain Expansion ( Ryōiki Tenkai ) is the most supreme technique of any jujutsu user. It is achieved by expanding one's innate domain with cursed energy while using a barrier to construct it inside a separate space. The caster then imbues their cursed technique within the barrier to complete the expansion, allowing them to deploy their ability all throughout the domain.

A specific hand sign or signal unique to the user is required to expand someone's respective domain. From the outside, a domain's barrier is normally completely closed, making it appear as a floating black sphere that can even be moved slightly if needed.

Upon your Domain being broken, or dispelling it manually, you instantly gain the condition [[Status Conditions#Restricted|Restricted]] 2.

Domains are forcibly broken if the user drops below half of their health, or sustains more than 30 points of damage in a single turn.

#### Duration & Cost:

The amount of turns a sorcerer can maintain their domain before it forcefully ends depends on the sorcerer's [[Statistics#Cursed Energy Efficiency|C.E Efficiency]] stat.

Costing 60 [[Statistics#Cursed Energy Max|cursed energy]] to initiate, the domain can be sustained for a base of 4 emotes; ending at the start of the player's 5th turn.

- At 35 C.E Efficiency the domain can be maintained for 5 full turns.
- At 45 C.E Efficiency the domain can be maintained for 6 full turns.
- At 55 C.E Efficiency the domain can be maintained for 7 full turns.

#### Moving the Domain:

You are capable of moving your Domain in any one direction during your turn, this includes causing it to elevate or lower, so long as it is not too heavily obstructed by external factors, such as buildings, mountains and other naturally occurring structures in the environment.

You can move your domain a total of 10 Meters in any one direction on your turn.

#### Sure-Hit Attack:

Domains that are expanded to be lethal are constructed within a barrier imbued with the user's cursed technique. The caster's abilities are amplified and any cursed techniques deployed within the domain are guaranteed to hit their target. This sure-hit factor is derived from the barrier's embedded technique, which is what makes this type of domain considered lethal. These can't-miss attacks can't even be stopped by the Gojo Clans Infinity. However, not all guaranteed hits are necessarily lethal.

While a target is within the confines of your Domain, they are subjected to its ‘Sure-Hit’. This means that whatever the speed of the Cursed Technique you launch within a Domain, it cannot be dodged, favorable evasion still applies to this ability. Additionally, depending on the style of Domain, you may get a number of ‘free’ attacks that occur each turn, the amount of these attacks will vary depending on this domain.

Additionally, the first Curse Technique you cast within the Domain has their C.E Output increase by +5.

### Domain Clash:

The best countermeasure against an opposing domain is to expand one's own domain. This will engage both combatants into a clash of domains where the more refined domain will conquer. The time it takes for one domain to dominate in a clash varies on that difference in refinement. In the case of overlapping domains, sure-hit effects cancel each other out.

When two domains are completely even and the users fight with their domains open, the moment one combatant takes heavy damage or their domain collapses, the other's can't-miss attack will immediately strike. A clash of three domains is even more complicated than two and too many conflicting factors can cause the barriers to shatter before the domains are completely formed.

While a Domain Clash is in effect, both ‘Sure-hit’ attacks are neutralized, the free attacks gained by a domain can still occur, but will instead move at the user's C.E Control, as though it were launched  outside of the domain. Domains can ‘clash’ so long as the difference between the individual C.E Output is not greater than ten ( a clash between a 35 Output and 45 Domain can happen, but not with 35 and 50 ). This scales off of both individuals' base statistics.
