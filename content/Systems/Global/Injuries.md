In a world as fraught with peril as the domain of cursed energy, avoiding harm altogether is a challenge even for the most skilled Jujutsu sorcerers. Injuries are as pervasive as the curses they battle, and they manifest in several common forms: Wounds, Burns, Fractures, and Poisoning. Each inflicts a unique debilitation on the afflicted individual, hindering their abilities until addressed through the expertise of a Jujutsu sorcerer or through the passage of time.

Despite the prevalence of injuries, they actively influence the outcomes of battles, compelling sorcerers to think swiftly and react decisively to prevent catastrophic harm. Every sorcerer's objective should be to minimise injuries while relentlessly pressuring their adversaries with a barrage of techniques and strategic assaults, wearing them down through attrition.

- Injuries of Level One can be healed without medical attention 2 IRL days after receiving them. Low chance for a permanent scar.
- Injuries of Level Two can be healed without medical attention 5 IRL days after receiving them. High chance for a permanent scar.
- Injuries of Level Three can be healed without medical attention 10 IRL days after receiving them. Permanent scar. 

> [!tip]
> Depending on the severity of the injury, a different level of ‘[[Status Conditions]]’ will be applied.
