Different from cursed objects, cursed tools are weapons infused with cursed energy. Due to this, even non-sorcerers can use them to combat cursed spirits. Conventional weapons such as katanas can become semi-cursed tools over time if the user constantly imbues it with their cursed energy. However, weapons new to the user that are reinforced with cursed energy are not considered cursed tools.

As with sorcerers and cursed spirits, cursed tools are categorized from grade one to four based on their power and potency. The higher the grade, the greater the advantage granted to the user in a jujutsu battle.

Powerful cursed tools are extremely valuable. Their monetary worth can range from five hundred thousand to upwards of five hundred million yen. All the cursed tools collected by the Big Three Sorcerer Families were stored in a vault called the cursed warehouse. Tokyo Jujutsu High's cursed warehouse is protected by Tengen's concealing barrier. 

When creating a Cursed Tool, you select a Size Category, Weapon Type and Weapon Grade. Descriptions of these can be found below, as well as a list of example weaponry.

## Size Categories
The size of a Cursed Tool can often predetermine the effectiveness of its use, smaller tools often requiring far less storage, and are capable of being wielded far more fluidly and quickly. At the opposite of this, there are large tools, who are easily noticed when being carried or wielded, with a devastating strength behind each swing. Middling tools are often a balance of each, sacrificing a portion of their bulk for their speed. 

> [!NOTE]
> Small weapons can instead be two weapons, each taking up 1 slot and gaining +1 ATK SPD each.

Every oc has 10 Slots worth of space on their body.

| Category. | Buff.                 | Weight. | Ex.                     |
| --------- | --------------------- | ------- | ----------------------- |
| Small     | +2 ATK SPD            | 1 Slot  | Dagger, Sickle, Cudgel. |
| Medium    | +1 ATK STR +1 ATK SPD | 3 Slots | Katana, Staff, Spear.   |
| Large     | +2 ATK STR            | 5 Slots | Nodachi, Naginata.      |

## Weapon Type
With this, you have ‘Weapon Types’, a crude description as to the type of damage inflicted in the wake of these techniques. Those that cut, break and pierce are generally considered the most common, awkwardly filtering weapons in to fit the standards of these claims. Cursed Tools will generally carry one of these properties, however there are exceptions to this rule.

| Weapon Type. | Injury.    | Ex.                       |
| ------------ | ---------- | ------------------------- |
| Slashing     | Laceration | Dagger, Katana, Nodachi.  |
| Blunt        | Fracture   | Hammer, Staff, Warhammer. |
| Piercing     | Puncture   | Spear, Javelin, Arrow.    |

## Weapon Grade
A weapons grade is the largest factor in deciding its lethality, each of the weapon grades are capable of causing an effective exorcism, yet their primary abilities show drastic and exponential growth in their difference. Low grade weapons have no curses infused within them, though as they climb through the ranks, these tools become capable of incredible feats. Going so far as to challenge even those who carry the blessing of the Limitless innate technique.

| Curse Grade.  | Buff. | Gimmick Ex.                              |
| ------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------- |

| Grade 3       | +2    | Enhanced Weapon Infusion, Easily Hidden. |
| Grade 2       | +4    | Improved Injury, Elemental Infusion      |
| Grade 1       | +6    | Infused Technique, Soul Cutting          |
