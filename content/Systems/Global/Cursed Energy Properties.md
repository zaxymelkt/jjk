There are rare cases where cursed energy carries a special property unique to its user. When applied to their fighting techniques, it can grant them a special texture or effect that gives them an advantage in battle. These special traits cannot be defended by simple reinforcement techniques.
# Course Cursed Energy
Described as cursed energy that has an "edge", a rough texture that makes every strike feel like their opponent is getting hit with a serrated bat. 
## Active Ability
Upon being struck by an opponent in a place where you have infused Cursed Energy, you can choose to release a reactionary blast of recoil. This blast is as strong as your C.E Output +3, and will always send them flying 5 Metres away from you. This recoil costs 15 Cursed Energy and has a 1 Turn Cooldown.
## Passive Ability
You always deal an additional 2 points of damage when striking your opponent, so long as you have infused Cursed Energy into your body. This damage ignores Toughness.
# Electrified Cursed Energy
Described as cursed energy that has the properties of electricity, which keeps their body in a constant state of electrification and makes all of their attacks nearly impossible to defend against. When infusing cursed energy, it lets off a buzzing hum that can be heard by those within 3m.
## Active Ability
You can release all of the built up charge held within your body, either through a burst of erratically flowing Cursed Energy directly before you, or through a line of concentrated electricity which travels from you to a Cursed Tool that has been recently infused with your Energy ( max. five turns ago ), so long as it is within 10 Metres. Everyone within range of this burst takes 2(x) points of damage, x being the number of charges stored. This will cost 5 Cursed Energy + 3(x). The damage sustained from this ability cannot be reduced.
## Passive Ability
Upon striking and making direct contact with your target, either through your own body or a Cursed Tool you've infused with your Cursed Energy. You gain one point of 'charge' , manifested by a low buzzing filling the air, originating from your Cursed Energy. You can only ever hold 5 total points of charge at any time.
# Chilled Cursed Energy
Described as cursed energy that consumes heat, giving the user a constant aura of ‘coldness’, causing frost to form on those who strike or are stricken by their cursed energy. When infusing cursed energy, a frosty aura can be felt 2m around the individual.
## Active Ability
Release a blast of icy cold energy (0.5m) upon being struck by an opponent while infusing cursed energy, enveloping them in chilling frost and slowing their movement (Frostbitten 2) for 1 turn. Costs 15 cursed energy with a 2-turn cooldown.
## Passive Ability
Naturally resistant to the cold, lowering 'frostbitten' levels by 1. Induce 'frostbitten 1' on the target every three hits with cursed energy.
# Heated Cursed Energy
Described as cursed energy that has the properties of fire, which keeps their body constantly heated, inflicting burns on those who are unlucky enough to experience their cursed energy. When infusing cursed energy, a hot, fiery aura can be felt within 2m of the individual.
## Active Ability
Create a blazing inferno (3x0.5m) that surges forward as an arrow of searing flames, burning foes and leaving a trail of destruction. The arrow has a strength of C.E Output. Inflicts 'burn 2' and costs 18 cursed energy with a 3-turn cooldown.
## Passive Ability
Naturally heat resistant, reducing burns by 1 level. Inflicts first-degree burns every 3 hits when cursed energy is infused.
# Venomous Cursed Energy
Described as cursed energy that has the properties of venom or poison. Their cursed energy is toxic once it enters the bloodstream, even small lesions on the skin is enough for the cursed energy to slither inside. When cursed energy is infused, a sickly aura can be felt within 2m of the individual.
## Active Ability
When you hit someone with a CE infused attack, you can spend 15 CE to inflict Poisoned 2 ( Poisoned 1 if you hit an area cloaked in CE ), which lasts 3 turns. Every time you hit them with CE Infusion it increases the turns by 1 to a max of three
## Passive Ability
You are immune to ‘poisoned’ up to level 3.
# Malevolent Cursed Energy
Malevolent Cursed Energy is characterised by its heavy and dense nature, concentrating its power into devastating strikes that shatter defences and overwhelm adversaries. When cursed energy is infused, the pressure of the cursed energy can be felt by those within 3m of the individual.
## Active Ability

Each strike inflicts massive damage and inflicts 'broken 1' on the victim and shreds up to 5 points. Consumes 15 cursed energy with a cooldown of 2 turns after three hits.
## Passive Ability
Infuse your cursed energy into a limb or cursed tool to stagger opponents with each strike, reducing their attacks by 1 for their current or next turn. This can be used once per target in a given turn.
# Steeled Cursed Energy
