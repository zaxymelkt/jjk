**In the world of Jujutsu, Sorcerers need to be not only proficient with their cursed techniques but also their hands and tool usage. At the start of a sorcerer’s career they begin with one martial-field and one weaponry-field.

By consuming Skill Points a Sorcerer is able to increase their skill in a particular field or branch into a new study.

- In order to gain Level 1 Mastery in a form of combat, you must spend 1 Skill Point.
- In order to gain Level 2 Mastery in a form of combat, you must spend 3 Skill Points.
- In order to gain Level 3 Mastery in a form of combat, you must spend 5 Skill Points.
- In order to gain Level 4 Mastery in a form of combat, you must spend 7 Skill Points.
- In order to gain Level 5 Mastery in a form of combat, you must spend 9 Skill Points.
Skill Point investment is concurrent. The above means ‘the total amount’ invested. 

> [!tip]
> The included Lv1 is considered to have 1 SP invested.

You may invest into a total of 16 levels across the entire system, the exact combination of levels does not matter.
# Hand-to-Hand Combat

Hand-to-Hand or Martial Combat Mastery is broken up into 4 fields of study: Offensive, Defensive, Reactionary, and Balance. Each has its strengths and finding a balance between the fighting styles is different for each individual. A single martial art is not composed of a single line of thinking, each incorporates some form of each system.
## Offensive

Offensive Combat deals with rapid and sudden flurries of attacks expertly woven together to prevent a target from putting up a defensive position. However, Offensive fighters often fight themselves in a difficult battle when faced against Reactionary.

## Defensive
Defensive Hand-to-Hand combat focuses on quickly protecting one’s self from incoming attacks and reducing the damage they do take from an assault. Defensive combat is most effective against balanced fighters, however, offensive combat typically overwhelms their defence.

## Reactionary
Reactionary combat focuses on counter-striking and interrupting a target’s momentum to ensure a strike and limit injury. They are the tricksters of the battle field, powerful against Offensive fighters but often outdone or matched by balanced fighters.

## Balance 

Balance combat focuses on a mix of defensive and offensive techniques, often using feints to mislead. Balanced fighters are often ‘grapplers’ due to the control they maintain. While effective against reactionary fighters, balanced combatants often find it difficult to break through a strong defensive guard.

# Weaponry Combat

There are 3 classifications of ‘weapons’ [Slashing | Blunt | Piercing]. Some weapons may be considered multiple classifications, but these will hopefully limit issues from that. If you are slashing with a weapon, it will follow [Slashing], if you are aiming to pierce or stab, it will follow [Piercing] rules.

  

Weapons capable of piercing will follow [Piercing : Ranged] when thrown or launched by hand or tool. [Blunt : Ranged] and [Slashing : Ranged] primarily will only deal with ‘chained’ weaponry.

> [!info] Proficiency
> - None: Either unable to use or difficult to use. If it’s a part of your levelled field, it will inflict injuries at -1 level [minimal of lvl 1]. If it was to bring the injury to none, the weapon will gain -2 swing speed due to the lack of ability.
> - Proficient: You are capable of fully utilising your weapon at the advertised rate. 
> - Expert: You are skilled, being able to inflict injuries up to an extra level.

### Ranged Projectile Guidelines

Depending on the levels invested into [Ranged] weaponry, the amount of projectiles that can be released or aimed within a given [turn] varies.

- Small Projectiles consume [1] Slot. 
- Medium Projectiles consume [2] Slots.
- Large Projectiles consume [4] Slots.

> [!NOTE]
> Each projectile will consume an attack slot.

## Slashing
Slashing focuses not only on swords but also any bladed weapon that can cause a laceration. Note, ‘ranged’ for slashing tools will not encompass ‘throwing’ a slashing weapon, that would turn the tool into a ‘piercing’ weapon when thrown.
### Melee Application
The typical use of a melee-weapon. Some tools may be injury limited beyond what levels allow.

## Blunt
Blunt focuses on any blunt tool. This could include bo-staffs, or even war-hammer based weapons.

> [!NOTE]
> Rather than increasing injury levels, [Expertise] will reduce the STR requirement by:
> - [ 4 ] Stable Fractures 
> - [ 3 ] Partial Fractures 
> - [ 2 ] Closed Fractures 
> - [ 1 ] Compound Fractures
### Melee Application
The typical use of a melee-weapon such as a hammer or bo-staff.

### Ranged Application
Other chained weapons such as the kusarigama’s fundo or a chain with a large metal ball. Although they will not gain any statistical benefits, if normal blunt weapons such as a staff or hammer is thrown, it will follow these rules.

## Piercing
Piercing focuses on weapons which inflict ‘piercing’, such as shuriken, kunai, arrow-tips, etc. For ‘piercing’ swords, the rapier is an example.
### Melee Application
While not many tools or weapons specialise in piercing, however, stabbing attacks will fall under these rules. Mainly Rapiers, Spears, and Needle-Blades will prioritise this skill.
