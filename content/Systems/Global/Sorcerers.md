# Grade
## Special Grade
Special Grade is a rank reserved for anomalies within the jujutsu community. It is reserved for sorcerers with such immense strength that their destructive potential is immeasurable, making them very exclusive and unique cases, hence the title "special". As a testament to its rarity, as of 2018, there are only four registered sorcerers with the Special Grade rank. Sukuna, a powerful curse user from the Heian Era, is recognised as the King of Curses, with his fingers and himself being collectively categorised as Special Grade.

### Special Grade 1
Special Grade 1 is a rank that refers to sorcerers outside of the technical school system (ungraded active sorcerers) whose power is considered to be on the level of a Grade 1 sorcerer.

**Caps**
- 50 in one [[Statistics|stats]].
- 45 in two [[Statistics|stats]]
- 40 in the [[Statistics|rest]].
**Requirements**
- **Systematic**
	- Promotion Points: 18
## Grade 1
Grade 1 sorcerers are the ones who uphold the standards of what a sorcerer should strive to be and are the ones fit to lead society. It is the highest status a sorcerer can hope to achieve through the natural progression of ranks, as Special Grade is something of a misrepresentation. The level of danger on missions, the amount of confidentiality entrusted to them, and the compensation are far greater than Semi-Grade 1 and below.

**Caps**
- 40 in two [[Statistics|stats]].
- 35 in the [[Statistics|rest]].
**Requirements**
- **Systematic**
	- Promotion Points: 12
### Semi-Grade 1
Semi-Grade 1 is a rank for sorcerers who have completed their accompanied missions following their recommendation for Grade 1 with satisfactory results.

**Caps**
- 35 in two [[Statistics|stats]].
- 30 in the [[Statistics|rest]].
**Requirements**
- **Systematic**
	- Promotion Points: 8
## Grade 2
Grade 2 is an above-average level for a sorcerer. Most great sorcerers are between Grades 1 and 2, so they are not by any means weak. It is exceptional for a student to be Grade 2, a status which allows them to take on solo assignments. A student receiving a Grade 2 rank upon enrolling is considered to be a genius

**Caps**
- 30 in two [[Statistics|stats]].
- 25 in the [[Statistics|rest]].

**Requirements**
- **Systematic**
	- Promotion Points: 4
### Semi-Grade 2
Little is known about the purpose of this intermediate rank.

**Caps**
- 25 in three [[Statistics|stats]].
- 20 in the [[Statistics|rest]].

**Requirements**
- **Systematic**
	- Promotion Points: 2
## Grade 3
Grade 3 is an average rank for jujutsu sorcerers to have, especially students. [[Fujiwara Emiko]] and [[Fujiwara Hoshikakushi]] were designated as Grade 3 due to distrust of their family, despite their genius with Cursed Energy.

**Caps**
- 25s in two [[Statistics|stats]].
- 20 in the [[Statistics|rest]].

**Requirements**
- **Social**
	- Average Cursed Energy.
	- Ability to see spirits.

- **Systematic**
	- Promotion Points: 0
## Grade 4
Grade 4 is a rank meant for weak and inexperienced sorcerers. [[Nakamura Shinji]] is the only known Grade 4 but this is due to the Great Families holding him back from promotion.

**Caps**
- 20 in two [[Statistics|stats]].
- 15 in the [[Statistics|rest]].

**Requirements**
- **Social**
	- Below Average Cursed Energy.

- **Systematic**
	- Promotion Points: 0

# Promotions
Jujutsu sorcerers can be promoted up in rank by receiving a recommendation from a sorcerer of a higher rank. The higher the rank, the more a sorcerer is paid for the more dangerous jobs that come with it. When it comes to students, their teachers are not permitted to submit a recommendation for their promotion.

A sorcerer submits a request for promotion based on their recommendation to one of the jujutsu higher-ups, such as Kyoto school Principal [[Amane Asahiro]].

When it comes to being promoted to Grade 1, upon receiving recommendations from two or more sorcerers of that rank, the nominee will accompany a sorcerer of that level on several missions. The one who accompanies the nominee can't be the same person who put in the recommendation. If they perform well on these missions, the nominee will be granted a Semi-Grade 1 rank and be assigned a mission to exorcise a Grade 1 alone. Based on the outcome of that, the decision to permit or deny Grade 1 status will be decided.

# Curse User
Curse Users are sorcerers who use jujutsu for evil and malicious deeds such as killing.

Evil non-sorcerers who possess knowledge of jujutsu and are active in the curse user community are known as Non-Curse Users

## Overview
A curse user is an evil human sorcerer who uses jujutsu with malintent. Naturally, they have existed as long as jujutsu sorcerers have, and were also prominent threats during the Heian Era alongside [[Cursed Spirits]].

With the increasing number of curses in the modern age, being a professional jujutsu sorcerer is a demanding job, and not all those born with the talent for jujutsu use it to exorcise curses. Jujutsu High is always understaffed with jujutsu sorcerers and those they do have are always busy.

Before 1989, curse users could freely make money by operating in the underworld and doing any dark deed asked of them. Bounties are commonplace in the jujutsu underworld.

Curse users remain active even in the 21st century but they are not as nearly as open about their activities. Organized groups such as [[Q]] and the non-curse users of the [[Time Vessel Association]] act mostly in secret.
