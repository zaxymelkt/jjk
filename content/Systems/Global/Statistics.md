# Physical Stats

## Strength [STR]

Strength determines the amount of weight an individual can lift, how high they can jump, as well as, the speed of thrown objects. Strength additionally determines the base strength of physical attacks, as well as an individual’s ability to resist against them.

- Strength within 2 will be treated as relative equivalent.
- Within 5 is a minor tussle
- Over 5, the force is overwhelming.

Lifting Strength is determined by multiplying STR by 5. You lift with your legs/entire body at 2.5x normal lifting STR. When using Cursed Energy to enhance one’s lifting ability, C.E. Output is divided by 10 [ ROUNDED DOWN ] and added to STR for the calculation.

The distance you can throw an object will depend on the item’s size:

- Small Items can be thrown STR x 2 in metres.
- Medium Items can be thrown STR in metres.
- Large Items can be thrown STR/2 in metres.
- Anything larger can be thrown STR/4 in metres.

## Endurance [END]

Endurance determines the amount of damage an individual can sustain over time and in a given moment. An Individual’s HP is determined by multiplying their END stat by 3. While Endurance will lessen the damage taken by an attack, even attacks significantly weaker will eat at a person’s HP.

When hit with an attack with a strength lower than your END, the damage dealt to your HP pool is equal to 1 + the buff on said attack. i.e ( 1 + 4 ) = 5 Points of Damage.

When hit with an attack with strength equal to your END, the damage dealt to your HP pool is equal to 3 + the buff on said attack. i.e ( 3 + 4 ) = 7 Points of Damage.

When hit with an attack with a strength that exceeds your END, the damage dealt to your HP pool is equal to 5 + the difference between your END and the attack. i.e ( 5 + 7 ) = 12 Points of Damage.

Damage taken can be reduced by protecting the area with cursed energy.

At 15, 25, 35, and 45 Endurance, an OC gains an additional 5 HP.

HP is a static stat, unaffected by END buffs or debuffs unless specified otherwise.

## Reaction [RAC]

Reaction determines reaction speed, limits ability activation per turn, and controls the amount of targets or projectiles one can focus on at a given time. Additionally Reaction will judge the distance at which Cursed Energy becomes passively noticeable.

- During ‘Pitch Black’ settings, visibility is set to 3m.
- During ‘Dark’ settings, visibility is set to 8m.
- When a target is hidden in an area absent of light, checks to view them are done at -5 Reaction.

Reacting to an attack requires both the reaction speed and agility, but also movement distance and positioning.

Attacks are defined as ‘full’ movement and or individual activations of a cursed technique, as well as the addition of a ‘Chant’. While an individual is able to respond to as many attacks as they can focus on, they can only dish out a set amount of physical combos or cursed techniques outside of defensive manoeuvres such as blocking, evading, or using Cursed Energy ‘cloaks’.

## Agility [SPD]

Agility determines movement distance, combative speed, and general acrobatics. When evading, blocking an attack within 5 SPD [ FAVOURABLE ], the location of injury can be adjusted but complete evasion is improbable. An attack beyond +5 SPD [ UNFAVOURABLE ], the location of injury is decided by the inflictor.

# Cursed Energy Stats

## C.E Output [C.E.O]

Cursed Energy Output determines the damage and destructive capability of an individual’s Cursed Energy techniques and attacks. Cursed Energy Output will additionally determine the durability of Cursed Energy attacks and even shikigami. Additionally, Cursed Energy Output will allow an individual to imbue themselves or items with Cursed Energy to enhance them.

When using Cursed Energy to protect or enhance a location, it will reduce the incoming damage by a set amount, depending on the level of Cloak used.

## C.E Control [C.E.C]

Cursed Energy Control determines how effectively an individual controls their Cursed Energy during application and moulding. Cursed Energy Control will dictate the speed at which most Cursed Energy travels; however, certain techniques may travel at ‘Sound’ or ‘Return stroke’ speeds due to their application source.

## C.E Efficiency [C.E.E]

Cursed Energy Efficiency determines how efficiently an individual can use Cursed Energy as well as assists in other factors of Cursed Technique usage.
| **Points Invested** | **Cost Effect (CE) Adjustment** | **Domain Use Duration Adjustment** |
|----------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **5** | Increased cost of 3 CE | N/A |
| **10** | Increased cost of 1 CE | N/A |
| **15** | No increase in cost | N/A |
| **20** | Decreased cost of 1 CE | N/A |
| **25** | Decreased cost of 3 CE | N/A |
| **30** | Decreased cost of 5 CE | N/A |
| **35** | Decreased cost of 7 CE<br> | Restricted status effect lowered by 1 |
| **40** | Decreased cost of 9 CE | Restricted status effect lowered by 1 |
| **45** | Decreased cost of 10 CE<br> | Restricted status effect lowered by 2 |
| **50** | Decreased cost of 12 CE<br> | Restricted status effect lowered by 3 |
| **55** | Decreased cost of 13 CE | Restricted status effect lowered by 3 |
| **60** | Decreased cost of 14 CE<br> | Restricted status effect lowered by 4 |

> [!NOTE]
> Cursed Techniques can only be lowered to ‘5’ C.E cost at most.

## C.E Maximum [C.E.M]

The amount of cursed energy you have is etched into your soul as birth. Because of this, you cannot expand your cursed energy reserves, but can learn to use less of it with your techniques.

While the exact amount may differ, generally sorcerers fall under these classifications: Absent, Insignificant, Below Average, Average, Above Average, High, and Monster.

| **Category**      | **Cursed Energy** | **Physical Stat Increase** |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Absent**        | 0                 | +7 Caps                    |
| **Insignificant** | 5                 | +5 Caps                    |
| **Below Average** | 80                | +2 Caps                    |
| **Average**       | 150               | N/A                        |
| **Above Average** | 220               | N/A                        |
| **High**          | 310               | N/A                        |
| **Monster**       | 430               | N/A                        |
