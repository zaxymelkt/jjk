 Taking from Wing Chun, this allows the user to quickly use the existing momentum to move an attack away. If STR is within 5, the attack can be redirected. This technique is exclusively defensive.
 
 - The user gains +2 SPD during use.
 - Has a 2 turn cooldown.
 - Consumes 1 action when used outside of combo.
 - Otherwise, it does not take a hit slot.
