# Dazed

Upon being struck with force enough to cause their brain to rebound against their skull, an individual will enter a status known as ‘Dazed’. All current techniques will end and they receive -5 SPD for the next turn. An Individual cannot be dazed for two turns consecutively, and must have at least one turn of not being dazed, before they can be dazed again. The only exception being ‘daze’ caused by Black Flash.

  

# Stunned

Upon being struck with a force enough to tense the body and scramble the brain, the ‘stunned’ status is applied. Those afflicted will be unable to action the turn after the status was applied and for the duration of the stun. Certain attacks may inflict the ‘stunned’ status due to electrical properties or similar. While stunned, techniques are deactivated and automated functions are nulled. You cannot be continuous stunned, having a 2 turn cooldown.

  

# Unconscious

Upon being struck with an attack of significant force or enough to drop an individual to 0 HP the ‘unconscious’ status is applied. Those afflicted will be incapable of actioning for the duration of the status effect and half a turn after. Conditions for the status effect ending require HP to be brought back from 0 or depending on the method used to inflict, outside movement or stimuli will wake.

  

# Near Death

Upon being struck with an attack capable of dropping an individual to below 0 HP [-15 HP] the ‘Near Death’ status is applied. Those afflicted will be incapable of normal actions, making ‘will to live’ rolls every turn. Near Death will end once ‘Death’ is applied or HP goes above 0. You can fail ‘will to live’ twice.

If an attack were to drop an individual to -16 from a 0 or higher, Near Death is skipped. This is not the case if already within near death.

Upon a successful ‘will to live’ the individual will recover 2 HP. If this brings them to above 0, they will be ‘unconscious’ but no longer ‘Near Death’.

- Near Death first turn, a 1d10, requiring a 4 or higher to remain alive. Otherwise the ‘Dead’ status is applied.
- Near Death second turn, a 1d10, requiring a 5 or higher to remain alive. Otherwise the ‘Dead’ status is applied.
- Near Death third turn, a 1d10, requiring a 6 or higher to remain alive. Otherwise the ‘Dead’ status is applied.
- Near Death fourth turn, a 1d10, requiring a 7 or higher to remain alive. Otherwise the ‘Dead’ status is applied.
- Near Death fifth turn, a 1d10, requiring a 8 or higher to remain alive. Otherwise the ‘Dead’ status is applied.
- Near Death sixth turn, a 1d10, requiring a 9 or higher to remain alive. Otherwise the ‘Dead’ status is applied.
- Near Death seventh turn, a 1d10, requiring a 10 to remain alive. Otherwise the ‘Dead’ status is applied.
# Dead
Upon failing a Near Death save or by sustaining too much damage to enter the condition [-16 HP], ‘Dead’ will be applied. In the final moments before death, an individual will exist in their own ‘mind palace’ of the afterlife, having a chance to decide if they will move on or anchor themselves with a curse. In the latter, control of the character is given up, only some input from the individual will be taken in consideration.
# Bleed
Upon being struck by a piercing or slashing attack, the ‘bleed’ condition is applied. Depending on the level of the wound, a different level of bleed will be applied. When ‘bleed’ is applied, the highest level of bleed will be used for damage calculations. Bleed will take effect the turn after it was inflicted.

- Bleed 1 will inflict an HP loss [of when inflicted] of 1/12th every turn. 
- Bleed 2 will inflict an HP loss [of when inflicted] of 1/9th every turn.
- Bleed 3 will inflict an HP loss [of when inflicted] of 1/7th every turn.
- Bleed 4 will inflict an HP loss [of when inflicted] of 1/5th every turn.
## Frostbitten
Upon being struck by a ‘chilled’ attack or being within an area at or below 0 degrees C this condition is applied. Depending on the degree or length of time, a different level of ‘Frostbitten’ is applied.

Being applied with Frostbitten 1 three times in a row will increase it to Frostbitten 2. This is the same for all levels of Frostbitten.

- Frostbitten 1 will inflict -3 MD, Agility, and Endurance to the afflicted location and -1 to the rest of the body. If the individual does not heat up within 15 turns, they will gain the ‘unconscious’ condition for 5 turns, after that, they will gain ‘near death’ condition.
- Frostbitten 2 will inflict -4 MD, Agility, and Endurance to the afflicted location and -2 to the rest of the body. If the individual does not heat up within 12 turns, they will gain the ‘unconscious’ condition for 4 turns, after that, they will gain ‘near death’ condition.
- Frostbitten 3 will inflict -5 MD, Agility, and Endurance to the afflicted location and -3 to the rest of the body. If the individual does not heat up within 10 turns, they will gain the ‘unconscious’ condition for 3 turns, after that, they will gain ‘near death’ condition. After 5 turns, they will die.
- Frostbitten 4 will inflict -6 MD, Agility, and Endurance to the afflicted location and -4 to the rest of the body. If the individual does not heat up within 8 turns, they will gain the ‘unconscious’ condition for 2 turns, after that, they will gain ‘near death’ condition. After 5 turns, they will die.
## Burned
Upon being struck by a ‘hot’ attack or being within an area at or above 100 degree C this condition is applied. Depending on the heat or amount, a different level of ‘burned’ will be applied.

Being applied with Burned 1 three times in a row will increase it to Burned 2. This is the same for all levels of Burned.

- Burned 1 will inflict -3 END, STR to the afflicted location. Every turn the damage inflicted from the burn initially is inflicted on the victim.
- Burned 2 will inflict -4 END, STR, and -2 SPD to the afflicted location. Every turn the damage +2 inflicted from the burn initially is inflicted on the victim.
- Burned 3 will inflict -5 END, STR to the afflicted location. The afflicted location will be unusable if END is lower than 40, otherwise -3 SPD. Every turn the damage +3 inflicted from the burn initially is inflicted on the victim.
- Burned 4 will inflict -7 END, STR to the afflicted location. The afflicted location will be unusable if END is lower than 55, otherwise -5 SPD. Every turn the damage +4 inflicted from the burn initially is inflicted on the victim.
# Restricted
Upon using a Domain Expansion or being hit with an attack which removes CE this condition is inflicted. The ‘Restricted’ status effect prevents activation or usage of Cursed Techniques. Depending on the amount of times an individual has been inflicted with this status, the length or level will increase.

- Restricted 1 will last 8 turns. During this time, cursed energy costs are increased by 5. Cursed Techniques are still usable.
- Restricted 2 will last 12 turns. During this time, cursed energy costs are increased by 7. Cursed Techniques are unusable.
- Restricted 3 will last 14 turns. During this time, cursed energy costs are increased by 10. Attempting to use Domain Expansion within 3 turns of this ending will result in brain damage and the ‘daze’ status effect to be inflicted.
- Restricted 4 will last 16 turns. During this time, cursed energy costs are increased by 20. Attempting to use Domain Expansion within 5 turns of this ending will result in brain damage and the ‘stunned’ status effect to be inflicted.
# Poisoned

Upon being hit with a poisonous or venomous substance, the ‘poisoned’ status effect is applied. The level applied will depend on the complexity of the poison.

The ‘poisoned’ status will increase in level every two inflictions of the same level of poison. Meaning it will require 4 Poisoned 1 status effects to increase to a level 3 or 8 for level 4. Unless healed or removed from the system, all poisons will give -x Reaction (-1 for level 1, -4 for lvl 4) even when the effects wear off.

- Poisoned 1 will last for 8 turns inflicting -3 Reaction. While the poison is in effect, the victim will lose 3 points of HP per turn. After 5 turns, the victim will lose access to movement in the inflicted area.
- Poisoned 2 will last for 12 turns inflicting -4 Reaction. While the poison is in effect, the victim will lose 5 points of HP per turn. After 5 turns, the victim will lose access to movement in the inflicted area. After 8 turns, it will spread to the rest of the body, inflicting the ‘stunned’ condition for 2 turns before turning to ‘daze’ for the remaining.
- Poisoned 3 will last for 15 turns inflicting -5 Reaction. While the poison is in effect, the victim will lose 7 points of HP per turn. After 5 turns, the victim will lose access to movement in the inflicted area. After 7 turns, it will spread to the rest of the body, inflicting the ‘stunned’ condition for 3 turns before turning to ‘daze’ for the remaining. Unless healed, they will still have 1 HP drained per turn.
- Poisoned 4 will last for 20 turns inflicting -6 Reaction. While the poison is in effect, the victim will lose 9 points of HP per turn. After 5 turns, the victim will lose access to movement in the inflicted area. After 6 turns, it will spread to the rest of the body, inflicting the ‘stunned’ condition for 3 turns before turning to ‘daze’ for the remaining. Unless healed, they will still have 3 HP drained per turn.
# Broken
Upon being hit with enough force to break a bone the ‘broken’ status is inflicted. Continued usage or damage of the afflicted area will increase the severity of the injury unless treated or healed. Every 2 inflictions of Broken of the same level on the same area will advance the status effect level.

WHEN the limb is unsupported and attacked, half the damage inflicted initially is returned. Otherwise, if supported and used or struck, it will follow the outline below.

- Broken 1 will inflict -4 STR, -4 END, and -3 SPD to the afflicted area. Using the afflicted area will damage the individual by the STR -5 used to inflict the wound. Without 20 END the area is unusable.
- Broken 2 will inflict -5 STR, -5 END, and -4 SPD to the afflicted area. Using the afflicted area will damage the individual by the STR -3 used to inflict the wound. Without 30 END the area is unusable.
- Broken 3 will inflict -6 STR, -6 END, and -5 SPD to the afflicted area. Using the afflicted area will damage the individual by the STR used to inflict the wound. Without 40 END the area is unusable.
- Broken 4 will inflict -7 STR, -7 END, and -6 SPD to the afflicted area. Using the afflicted area will damage the individual by the STR +5 used to inflict the wound. Without 55 END the area is unusable.
# Toughness
Cursed Spirits are wicked things, some of which often exhibit traits of regeneration. This phenomenon has been dubbed ‘Toughness’, believed to not be true healing, but instead a buffer of health that mitigates damage to their physicality.

The buffer of toughness must be reduced to 0 before damage can be done to a Spirit's health. Additionally attacks or abilities will not apply status Conditions to a Curse so long as its Toughness Remains.

- Toughness 1 will give a Cursed Spirit a buffer of 5, regenerating at the end of their next turn.
- Toughness 2 will give a Cursed Spirit a buffer of 10, regenerating at the end of their next turn.
- Toughness 3 will give a Cursed Spirit a buffer of 15, regenerating at the start of their turn.
- Toughness 4 will give a Cursed Spirit a buffer of 20, regenerating at the start of their turn.
- Toughness 5 will give a Cursed Spirit a buffer of 25, regenerating at the start of their turn.
# Zone
Often described to be similar to the state of elite focus and the feeling of being at the centre of everything around them, many Sorcerers have described this to be a high on parallel to the actions of an athlete moving through the motions, their manipulation of Cursed Energy becoming as natural to them as breathing, and as thoughtless as the beating of their own heart.
