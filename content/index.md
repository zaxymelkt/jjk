title: "Jujutsu Kaisen : Cursed Cataclysm"
---
Within the modern world, the existence of Jujutsu Sorcerers and Jujutsu Society is kept secret from mankind. Those born with the innate connection to Cursed Energy take unto themselves a great secret they must hold so long as they shall live, less they bring about catastrophe and panic from revealing themselves to the world. However, there are well kept servers even among those who live within Jujutsu Society. Whispered only between greying elders and stories long since spoken, it is within this secret of a secret that **[[Master Tengen]]** dwells. Hidden away since the Nara Period, Tengen is the anchor-point at which Cursed Energy flows between, erecting massively potent barriers, keeping this world and what lies beyond from collapsing against one another, and giving birth to a great calamity. 

Master Tengen accomplishes this through their talent of Immortality, their lifetime extended to the vastness of Infinity. Though, this is only possible through the sacrifice of the [ Star Plasma Vessel ], an individual born every five hundred years, who must sacrifice themselves in order for Lord Tengen to preserve. It is now that the cycle of five hundred years begins to elapse, as Lord Tengen grows weary, the barriers begin to weaken, giving way to a higher influx of Cursed Energy to enter this world. Producing not only an increased amount of Sorcerers born both in and outside of Jujutsu Society, but a festering brood of Cursed Spirits as well. 

Through the use of her Clairvoyance, Principal Amane Asahiro has gathered twelve specific students to have enrolled as First Years within Kyoto Technical College, as her predictions see one of them barring the burden and blessing of the Star Plasma Vessel. As the months pass by, they hope that the Vessel will reveal themselves, so that catastrophe can be avoided. And yet, it seems that it may already be too late. Schisms forming among the great families in the wake of an event known as the "Deathwalk", which occurred only months prior within the sacred home of Kyoto Tech itself. With Curses on the rise, Sorcerers inching closer to civil war, and a Vessel yet to reveal themselves. . .
