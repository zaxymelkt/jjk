# Chapter 2
Awakening his innate technique, [[Innate Technique|Shrine]], at the age of six, his introduction resulted in harsh punishment towards him due to the damage he caused to the house. His ‘Shrine’ has two applications, [[Innate Technique#Cleave|Cleave]] and [[Innate Technique#Dismantle|Dismantle]], each having its strengths and weaknesses, but overall, it allowed him great control over close-ranged and mid-ranged combat.

As a child, Hoshikakushi would study [[Martial Arts]]. He would show adept skill in [[Statistics#Output|Cursed Energy Output]], [[Statistics#Efficiency|Efficiency]], and [[Statistics#Control|Control]]. Those who trained with him often described that he never seemed to ‘understand’ the concepts or teachings, or rather, Hoshikakushi would ‘mimic’ them until he ‘came across’ the solution. It would work for him in the starting stage of training — swinging a staff isn’t tricky to do — learning to do it in movement or combat is a different skill.

In Hoshikakushi’s free time, he would practise with [[Fujiwara Emiko]] to develop their knowledge of ‘Cursed Energy’, which their Older siblings were only marginally decent at tutoring. During this time, he found little time to hang out with [[Abe Toma]]; however, Hoshikakushi has admitted he enjoys their time together.
