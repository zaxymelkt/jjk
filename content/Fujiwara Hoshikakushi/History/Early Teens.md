# Chapter 4
Since beginning public school after their family had moved to Kyoto, Hoshikakushi would frequently find himself in trouble due to fighting the other boys and intimidating the girls. Hoshikakushi’s defence was that they were bullying his little sister [[Fujiwara Emiko]]. Oddly, those not in fear of him, were infatuated with his speech pattern, but his distant attitude and gaze kept most away.

What seemed to confuse Hoshikakushi most was seeing [[Abe Toma]] arrive at the very same school, not that he minded; Abe Toma was convenient to have around, good company. He looked back upon his early promise with Abe Toma, “We’ll remain friends, even in death”, he wondered if that would have made it a ‘binding vow’.

As time went on, the fights Hoshikakushi found himself in began to slowly escalate. There had begun rumours of the damage inflicted upon others without a single punch thrown. Some began to mention how hitting Hoshikakushi felt like punching cement, and his fists felt like a bat However, Hoshikakushi never wanted to fight or mangle, but almost out of instinct, he couldn’t control it, his [[Cursed Energy]] imbued into energy punch. 

During middle school Hoshikakushi would gain the nickname “四条の人間の刃”. Outside of Abe Toma and Fujiwara Emiko, all the other students knew him as Kujou Reien the man who spoke poetics.
