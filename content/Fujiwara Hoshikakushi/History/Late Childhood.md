# Chapter 3
As Hoshikakushi continued his study, he found Ju Jitsu to be unfitting with his methodology. At this stage in his life, he focused on defensive combat, only wanting to fight if he must — moving away from pursuing the life of jujutsu. It was a coincidence that he came across a lone Wing Chun dojo that advertised being modified to fit ‘street fighting’ and being closer to an open palm Karate than its origin. 

He didn’t attend the dojo for long, only having the summer free to be that far from home. During this time, his sensei told him, 

"Combat isn't inherently violent. Fighters articulate themselves through their battles, striving to defend something meaningful — even if it's a self-serving motive like wealth or status. Engaging in combat for the sake of combat is violence; if one must fight, let it be to safeguard, not to inflict harm."

Hoshikakushi, he understood what his sensei was attempting to tell him. However, it was a mute point towards the boy. He had something to protect, it was the only reason he bothered to go along with the Fujiwara’s wishes and be a sorcerer, an assassin. His aversion to the career extends to his younger siblings, going so far as to make a binding vow with his elder’s to spare his siblings from being forced to become or be one; what they asked in return is unknown to even Hoshikakushi.
