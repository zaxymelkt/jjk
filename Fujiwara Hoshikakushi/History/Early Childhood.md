# Chapter 1
Fujiwara Hoshikakushi was born in [[Semboku City|Semboku]], Japan, a small city—with a population of around 26,000. With a rough population density of 29.8 people every square kilometre, Fujiwara Hoshikakushi would have to travel over 200 kilometres to meet another sorcerer like himself. Had fate not decided otherwise, Hoshikakushi would have been alone.


Born to the Fujiwara Clan, Hoshikakushi had twelve siblings, born in the middle of all of them. Until Hoshikakushi’s birth and later Fujiwara Emiko’s, the family had yet to birth a sorcerer with an innate technique. Hoshikakushi’s technique is [[Innate Technique|Shrine]], once held by the same man who massacred his clan in the Heian Era.


In the sorcerer world, rumours that the Fujiwara Clan hasn’t birthed an innate technique for three generations have become common.


Of his family, Hoshikakushi had many siblings: [[Fujiwara Hotaru|Hotaru]], [[Fujiwara Yoshitsune|Yoshitsune]], [[Fujiwara Sadako|Sadako]], [[Fujiwara Heitaro|Heitaro]], [[Fujiwara Tadahiro|Tadahiro]], [[Fujiwara Hinata|Hinata]], [[Fujiwara Ayame|Ayame]], [[Fujiwara Emiko|Emiko]], [[Fujiwara Kazuki|Kazuki]], [[Fujiwara Haruki|Haruki]], [[Fujiwara Sakura|Sakura]], [[Fujiwara Kaito|Kaito]]. Only four of his siblings became sorcerers. Hoshikakushi’s eldest sibling is 20-years-old, his youngest sibling is 9-years-old. His younger sister, Fujiwara Emiko, possesses a different innate technique than himself.

Fujiwara Hoshikakushi had one friend. How they met, no one knows for certainty. Fujiwara Emiko states, “He saved him from wolves!” Fujiwara Hanji, “He offered him some food, and he stuck around.” Hoshikakushi never comments on when their friendship started or even when they met. The only confirmed truth is that they met sometime before his sixth birthday. His friend’s name is [[Abe Toma]].
